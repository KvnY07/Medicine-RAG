# MANUFACTURE OF STERILE MEDICINAL PRODUCTS

## PRINCIPLE

The manufacture of sterile products is subject to special requirements in order to minimise risks of microbiological contamination, and of particulate and pyrogen contamination. Much depends on the skill, training and attitudes of the personnel involved. Quality Assurance is particularly important, and this type of manufacture must strictly follow carefully established and validated methods of preparation and procedure. Sole reliance for sterility or other quality aspects must not be placed on any terminal process or finished product test.

Note: This guidance does not lay down detailed methods for determining the microbiological and particulate cleanliness of air, surfaces, etc. Reference should be made to other documents such as the EN/ISO Standards.

## GENERAL

A. The manufacture of sterile products should be carried out in clean areas entry to which should be through airlocks for personnel and/or for equipment and materials. Clean areas should be maintained to an appropriate cleanliness standard and supplied with air which has passed through filters of an appropriate efficiency.

B. The various operations of component preparation, product preparation and filling should be carried out. in separate areas within the clean area. Manufacturing operations are divided into two categories; firstly those where the product is terminally sterilised, and secondly those which are conducted aseptically at some or all stages.

C. Clean areas for the manufacture of sterile products are classified according to the required characteristics of the environment. Each manufacturing operation requires an appropriate environmental cleanliness level. in the operational state in order to minimise the risks of particulate or microbial contamination of the product or materials being handled.

In order to meet "in operation' conditions these areas should be designed to reach certain specified aircleanliness levels in the "at rest' occupancy state. The "at rest' state is the condition where the installation is installed and operating, complete with production equipment but with no operating personnel present. The "in operation' state is the condition where the installation is functioning in the defined operating mode with the specified number of personnel working.

The "in operation' and "at rest' states should be defined for each clean room or suite of clean rooms.
For the manufacture of sterile medicinal products 4 grades can be distinguished..

Grade A: The local zone for high risk operations, e.g. filling zone, stopper bowls, open ampoules and vials, making aseptic connections. Normally such conditions are provided by a laminar air flow work station. Laminar air flow systems should provide a homogeneous air speed in a range of 0.36 -- $0.54\,\mathrm{m/s}$ (guidance value) at the working position in open clean room applications. The maintenance of laminarity should be demonstrated and validated.

A uni-directional air flow and lower velocities may be used in closed isolators and glove boxes.
Grade B: For aseptic preparation and filling, this is the background environment for the grade A zone.
Grade C and D: Clean areas for carrying out less critical stages in the manufacture of sterile products.

## CLEAN ROOM AND CLEAN AIR DEVICE CLASSIFICATION

D. Clean rooms and clean air devices should be classified in accordance with EN ISO 14644-1.

Classification should be clearly differentiated from operational process environmental monitoring. The maximum permitted airborne particle concentration for each grade is given in the following table:

<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;">

    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">Grade</th>

      <td>not defined</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
E. For classification purposes in Grade A zones, a minimum sample volume of $1\mathrm{m}^{3}$ should be taken per sample location. For Grade A the airborne particle classification is ISO 4.8 dictated by the limit for particles ${>}5.0\ |_{\bf{J}}$ m. For Grade B (at rest) the airborne particle classification is ISO 5 for both considered particle sizes. For Grade C (at rest & in operation) the airborne particle classification is ISO 7 and ISO 8 respectively. For Grade D (at rest) the airborne particle classification is ISO 8. For classification purposes EN/ISO 14644-1 methodology defines both the minimum number of sample locations and the sample size based on the class limit of the largest considered particle size and the method of evaluation of the data. collected.

F. Portable particle counters with a short length of sample tubing should be used for classification purposes because of the relatively higher rate of precipitation of particles ${\tt>}5.0^{\wedge}\mathrm{m}$ in remote sampling systems with long lengths of tubing. Isokinetic sample heads should be used in unidirectional airflow systems. G. "In operation' classification may be demonstrated during normal operations, simulated operations or during media fills as worst-case simulation is required for this. EN ISO 14644-2 provides information on testing to demonstrate continued compliance with the assigned cleanliness classifications..

## CLEAN ROOM AND CLEAN AIR DEVICE MONITORING

H. Clean rooms and clean air devices should be routinely monitored in operation and the monitoring 1ocations based on a formal risk analysis study and the results obtained during the classification of rooms and/or clean air devices.

1. For Grade A zones, particle monitoring should be undertaken for the full duration of critical processing, including equipment assembly, except where justified by contaminants in the process that would damage the particle counter or present a hazard, e.g. live organisms and radiological hazards. In such cases monitoring during routine equipment set up operations should be undertaken prior to exposure to the risk. Monitoring during simulated operations should also be performed. The Grade A zone should be monitored at such a frequency and with suitable sample size that all interventions, transient events and any system deterioration would be captured and alarms triggered if alert limits are exceeded. It is accepted that it may not always be possible to demonstrate low levels of $>\!5.0$ [jm particles at the point of fill when filling is in progress, due to the generation of particles or droplets from the product itself.

J. It is recommended that a similar system be used for Grade B zones although the sample frequency may. be decreased. The importance of the particle monitoring system should be determined by the effectiveness of the segregation between the adjacent Grade A and B zones. The Grade B zone should be monitored at such a frequency and with suitable sample size that changes in levels of contamination and any system deterioration would be captured and alarms triggered if alert limits are exceeded.

K. Airborne particle monitoring systems may consist of independent particle counters; a network of sequentially accessed sampling points connected by manifold to a single particle counter; or a combination of the two. The system selected must be appropriate for the particle size considered. Where remote sampling. systems are used, the length of tubing and the radii of any bends in the tubing must be considered in the context of particle losses in the tubing. The selection of the monitoring system should take account of any. risk presented by the materials used in the manufacturing operation, for example those involving live. organisms or radiopharmaceuticals.

L. The sample sizes taken for monitoring purposes using automated systems will usually be a function of. the sampling rate of the system used. It is not necessary for the sample volume to be the same as that used for formal classification of clean rooms and clean air devices..

M. In Grade A and B zones, the monitoring of the. $>\!5.0$ |jm particle concentration count takes on a particular significance as it is an important diagnostic tool for early detection of failure. The occasional indication of $>\!5.0$ jm particle counts may be false counts due to electronic noise, stray light, coincidence, etc. However. consecutive or regular counting of low levels is an indicator of a possible contamination event and should be investigated. Such events may indicate early failure of the HVAC system, filling equipment failure or may also be diagnostic of poor practices during machine set-up and routine operation..

N. The particle limits given in the table for the "at rest' state should be achieved after a short "clean up" period of 15-20 minutes (guidance value) in an unmanned state after completion of operations.

O. The monitoring of Grade C and D areas in operation should be performed in accordance with the principles of quality risk management. The requirements and alert/action limits will depend on the nature of the operations carried out, but the recommended "clean up period' should be attained.

P. Other characteristics such as temperature and relative humidity depend on the product and nature of the operations carried out. These parameters should not interfere with the defined cleanliness standard.

Q. Examples of operations to be carried out in the various grades are given in the table below (see also paragraphs 28 to 35):

<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left; width: 100%;">

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

R. Where aseptic operations are performed monitoring should be frequent using methods such as settle plates, volumetric air and surface sampling (e.g. swabs and contact plates). Sampling methods used in operation should not interfere with zone protection. Results from monitoring should be considered when. reviewing batch documentation for finished product release. Surfaces and personnel should be monitored after critical operations. Additional microbiological monitoring is also required outside production operations, e.g. after validation of systems, cleaning and sanitisation..

</table>

Notes: (a) These are average values.

​	   (b) Individual settle plates may be exposed for less than 4 hours.

T. Appropriate alert and action limits should be set for the results of particulate and microbiological monitoring. If these limits are exceeded operating procedures should prescribe corrective action.

## ISOLATOR TECHNOLOGY

U. The utilisation of isolator technology to minimise human interventions in processing areas may result in a significant decrease in the risk of microbiological contamination of aseptically manufactured products from the environment. There are many possible designs of isolators and transfer devices. The isolator and the background environment should be designed so that the required air quality for the respective zones can be realised. Isolators are constructed of various materials more or less prone to puncture and leakage. Transfer devices may vary from a single door to double door designs to fully sealed systems incorporating sterilisation mechanisms.

V. The transfer of materials into and out of the unit is one of the greatest potential sources of contamination.. In general the area inside the isolator is the local zone for high risk manipulations, although it is recognised that laminar air flow may not exist in the working zone of all such devices.. W. The air classification required for the background environment depends on the design of the isolator and its application. It should be controlled and for aseptic processing it should be at least grade D. X. Isolators should be introduced only after appropriate validation. Validation should take into account all critical factors of isolator technology, for example the quality of the air inside and outside (background) the isolator, sanitisation of the isolator, the transfer process and isolator integrity.

Y. Monitoring should be carried out routinely and should include frequent leak testing of the isolator and glove/sleeve system.

## BLOW/FILL/SEAL TECHNOLOGY

Z. Blow/fill/seal units are purpose built machines in which, in one continuous operation, containers are. formed from a thermoplastic granulate, filled and then sealed, all by the one automatic machine.. Blow/fill/seal equipment used for aseptic production which is fitted with an effective grade A air shower. may be installed in at least a grade C environment, provided that grade A/B clothing is used. The environment should comply with the viable and non viable limits at rest and the viable limit only when in operation. Blow/fill/seal equipment used for the production of products which are terminally sterilised. should be installed in at least a grade D environment..

A. Because of this special technology particular attention should be paid to, at least the following:

1) equipment design and qualification
2) validation and reproducibility of cleaning-in-place and sterilisation-inplace
3) background clean room environment in which the equipment is located
4) operator training and clothing
5) interventions in the critical zone of the equipment including any aseptic assembly prior to the
commencement of filling.

## TERMINALLY STERILISED PRODUCTS

B. Preparation of components and most products should be done in at least a grade D environment in order to give low risk of microbial and particulate contamination, suitable for filtration and sterilisation. Where the product is at a high or unusual risk of microbial contamination, (for example, because the product actively supports microbial growth or must be held for a long period before sterilisation or is necessarily processed not mainly in closed vessels), then preparation should be carried out in a grade C environment.. C. Filling of products for terminal sterilisation should be carried out in at least a grade C environment. D. Where the product is at unusual risk of contamination from the environment, for example because the filling operation is slow or the containers are wide-necked or are necessarily exposed for more than a few seconds before sealing, the filling should be done in a grade A zone with at least a grade C background. Preparation and filling of ointments, creams, suspensions and emulsions should generally be carried out in a grade C environment before terminal sterilisation.

## ASEPTIC PREPARATION

E. Components after washing should be handled in at least a grade D environment. Handling of sterile starting materials and components, unless subjected to sterilisation or filtration through a micro-organismretaining filter later in the process, should be done in a grade A environment with grade B background. F. Preparation of solutions which are to be sterile filtered during the process should be done in a grade C environment; if not filtered, the preparation of materials and products should be done in a grade A environment with a grade B background.
G. Handling and filling of aseptically prepared products should be done in a grade A environment with a grade B background.
H. Prior to the completion of stoppering, transfer of partially closed containers, as used in freeze drying, should be done either in a grade A environment with grade B background or in sealed transfer trays in a grade B environment.

1. Preparation and filling of sterile ointments, creams, suspensions and emulsions should be done in a grade A environment, with a grade B background, when the product is exposed and is not subsequently filtered.

## PERSONNEL

J. Only the minimum number of personnel required should be present in clean areas; this is particularly
important during aseptic processing. Inspections and controls should be conducted outside the clean areas.
as far as possible.
K. All personnel (including those concerned with cleaning and maintenance) employed in such areas should
receive regular training in disciplines relevant to the correct manufacture of sterile products. This training
should include reference to hygiene and to the basic elements of microbiology. When outside staff who
have not received such training (e.g. building or maintenance contractors) need to be brought in, particular
care should be taken over their instruction and supervision.
L. Staff who have been engaged in the processing of animal tissue materials or of cultures of micro
organisms other than those used in the current manufacturing process should not enter sterile-product areas.
unless rigorous and clearly defined entry procedures have been followed.
M. High standards of personal hygiene and cleanliness are essential. Personnel involved in the manufacture
of sterile preparations should be instructed to report any condition which may cause the shedding of.
abnormal numbers or types of contaminants; periodic health checks for such conditions are desirable.
Actions to be taken about personnel who could be introducing undue microbiological hazard should be
decided by a designated competent person.
O. Changing and washing should follow a written procedure designed to minimise contamination of clean
area clothing or carry-through of contaminants to the clean areas.
P. The clothing and its quality should be appropriate for the process and the grade of the working area. It
should be worn in such a way as to protect the product from contamination.
Q. The description of clothing required for each grade is given below: 6) Grade D: Hair and, where relevant, beard should be covered. A general protective suit and appropriate shoes or overshoes should be worn. Appropriate measures should be taken to avoid any. contamination coming from outside the clean area. 7) Grade C: Hair and where relevant beard and moustache should be covered. A single or two-piece trouser suit, gathered at the wrists and with high neck and appropriate shoes or overshoes should be worn. They should shed virtually no fibres or particulate matter. 8) Grade A/B: Headgear should totally enclose hair and, where relevant, beard and moustache; it should be tucked into the neck of the suit; a face mask should be worn to prevent the shedding of. droplets. Appropriate sterilised, non-powdered rubber or plastic gloves and sterilised or disinfected footwear should be worn. Trouser-legs should be tucked inside the footwear and garment sleeves into the gloves. The protective clothing should shed virtually no fibres or particulate matter and retain. particles shed by the body.
R. Outdoor clothing should not be brought into changing rooms leading to grade B and C rooms. For every.
worker in a grade A/B area, clean sterile (sterilised or adequately sanitised) protective garments should be
provided at each work session. Gloves should be regularly disinfected during operations. Masks and gloves
should be changed at least for every working session.
S. Clean area clothing should be cleaned and handled in such a way that it does not gather additional
facilities for such clothing are desirable. Inappropriate treatment of clothing will damage fibres and may
increase the risk of shedding of particles.

## PREMISES

T. In clean areas, all exposed surfaces should be smooth, impervious and unbroken in order to minimise the shedding or accumulation of particles or micro-organisms and to permit the repeated application of cleaning agents, and disinfectants where used.

U. To reduce accumulation of dust and to facilitate cleaning there should be no uncleanable recesses and a minimum of projecting ledges, shelves, cupboards and equipment. Doors should be designed to avoid those uncleanable recesses; sliding doors may be undesirable for this reason..
V. False ceilings should be sealed to prevent contamination from the space above them.
W. Pipes and ducts and other utilities should be installed so that they do not create recesses, unsealed openings and surfaces which are difficult to clean.
X. Sinks and drains should be prohibited in grade A/B areas used for aseptic manufacture. In other areas air breaks should be fitted between the machine or sink and the drains. Floor drains in lower grade clean rooms should be fitted with traps or water seals to prevent backflow..
Y. Changing rooms should be designed as airlocks and used to provide physical separation of the different. stages of changing and so minimise microbial and particulate contamination of protective clothing. They state, be the same grade as the area into which it leads. The use of separate changing rooms for entering and leaving clean areas is sometimes desirable. In general hand washing facilities should be provided only in the first stage of the changing rooms.
Z. Both airlock doors should not be opened simultaneously. An interlocking system or a visual and/or audible warning system should be operated to prevent the opening of more than one door at a time. A. A filtered air supply should maintain a positive pressure and an air flow relative to surrounding areas of a lower grade under all operational conditions and should flush the area effectively. Adjacent rooms of different grades should have a pressure differential of 10-15 pascals (guidance values). Particular attention product and cleaned components which contact the product are exposed. The various recommendations regarding air supplies and pressure differentials may need to be modified where it becomes necessary to contain some materials, e.g. pathogenic, highly toxic, radioactive or live viral or bacterial materials or products. Decontamination of facilities and treatment of air leaving a clean area may be necessary for some operations.

taken to ensure that air flows do not distribute particles from a particle generating person, operation or machine to a zone of higher product risk.

C. A warning system should be provided to indicate failure in the air supply. Indicators of pressure differences should be fitted between areas where these differences are important. These pressure differences should be recorded regularly or otherwise documented..

## EQUIPMENT

D. A conveyor belt should not pass through a partition between a grade A or B area and a processing area of lower air cleanliness, unless the belt itself is continually sterilised (e.g. in a sterilising tunnel).. E. As far as practicable equipment, fittings and services should be designed and installed so that operations, maintenance and repairs can be carried out outside the clean area. If sterilisation is required, it should be carried out, wherever possible, after complete reassembly..
F. When equipment maintenance has been carried out within the clean area, the area should be cleaned, disinfected and/or sterilised where appropriate, before processing recommences if the required standards of cleanliness and/or asepsis have not been maintained during the work..
G. Water treatment plants and distribution systems should be designed, constructed and maintained so as to ensure a reliable source of water of an appropriate quality. They should not be operated beyond their designed capacity. Water for injections should be produced, stored and distributed in a manner which prevents microbial growth, for example by constant circulation at a temperature above. $70^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$
H. All equipment such as sterilisers, air handling and filtration systems, air vent and gas filters, water

treatment, generation, storage and distribution systems should be subject to validation and planned maintenance; their return to use should be approved..

## SANITATION

1. The sanitation of clean areas is particularly important. They should be cleaned thoroughly in accordance with a written programme. Where disinfectants are used, more than one type should be employed. Monitoring should be undertaken regularly in order to detect the development of resistant strains..

J. Disinfectants and detergents should be monitored for microbial contamination; dilutions should be kept in previously cleaned containers and should only be stored for defined periods unless sterilised. Disinfectants and detergents used in Grades A and B areas should be sterile prior to use..

K. Fumigation of clean areas may be useful for reducing microbiological contamination in inaccessible places.

## PROCESSING

L. Precautions to minimise contamination should be taken during all processing stages including the stages before sterilisation.

M. Preparations of microbiological origin should not be made or filled in areas used for the processing of other medicinal products; however, vaccines of dead organisms or of bacterial extracts may be filled, after inactivation, in the same premises as other sterile medicinal products.

N. Validation of aseptic processing should include a process simulation test using a nutrient medium (media fill).Selection of the nutrient medium should be made based on dosage form of the product and selectivity, clarity, concentration and suitability for sterilisation of the nutrient medium.

O. The process simulation test should imitate as closely as possible the routine aseptic manufacturing. process and include all the critical subsequent manufacturing steps. It should also take into account various interventions known to occur during normal production as well as worst-case situations..

P. Process simulation tests should be performed as initial validation with three consecutive satisfactory simulation tests per shift and repeated at defined intervals and after any significant modification to the HVAC-system, equipment, process and number of shifts. Normally process simulation tests should be repeated twice a year per shift and process. In the case of radiopharmaceuticals, the number of process simulation tests can be adjusted, where there is a clear reason for that.

Q. The number of containers used for media fills should be sufficient to enable a valid evaluation. For small batches, the number of containers for media fills should at least equal the size of the product batch. The target should be zero growth and the following should apply:.

9) When filling fewer than 5000 units, no contaminated units should be detected.
10) When filling 5,000 to 10,000 units:. a) One (1) contaminated unit should result in an investigation, including consideration of a repeat media fill; b) Two (2) contaminated units are considered cause for revalidation, following investigation.
11) When filling more than 10,000 units: a) One (1) contaminated unit should result in an investigation;. b) Two (2) contaminated units are considered cause for revalidation, following investigation.

R. For any run size, intermittent incidents of microbial contamination may be indicative of low-level contamination that should be investigated. Investigation of gross failures should include the potential impact on the sterility assurance of batches manufactured since the last successful media fill.

S. Care should be taken that any validation does not compromise the processes.

T. Water sources, water treatment equipment and treated water should be monitored regularly for chemical and biological contamination and, as appropriate, for endotoxins. Records should be maintained of the

results of the monitoring and of any action taken.

U. Activities in clean areas and especially when aseptic operations are in progress should be kept to a. minimum and movement of personnel should be controlled and methodical, to avoid excessive shedding of

particles and organisms due to over-vigorous activity. The ambient temperature and humidity should not be uncomfortably high because of the nature of the garments worn.
V. Microbiological contamination of starting materials should be minimal. Specifications should include requirements for microbiological quality when the need for this has been indicated by monitoring. W. Containers and materials liable to generate fibres should be minimised in clean areas.
X. Where appropriate, measures should be taken to minimise the particulate contamination of the end product.
Y. Components, containers and equipment should be handled after the final cleaning process in such a way that they are not recontaminated.
Z. The interval between the washing and drying and the sterilisation of components, containers and equipment as well as between their sterilisation and use should be minimised and subject to a time-limit appropriate to the storage conditions.
A. The time between the start of the preparation of a solution and its sterilisation or filtration through a micro-organism-retaining filter should be minimised. There should be a set maximum permissible time for each product that takes into account its composition and the prescribed method of storage.
B. The bioburden should be monitored before sterilisation. There should be working limits on contamination immediately before sterilisation, which are related to the efficiency of the method to be used. Bioburden assay should be performed on each batch for both aseptically filled product and terminally sterilised products. Where overkill sterilisation parameters are set for terminally sterilised products, bioburden might be monitored only at suitable scheduled intervals. For parametric release systems, bioburden assay should be performed on each batch and considered as an in-process test. Where appropriate the level of endotoxins should be monitored. All solutions, in particular large volume infusion fluids, should be passed through a microorganism-retaining filter, if possible sited immediately before filling.
C. Components, containers, equipment and any other article required in a clean area where aseptic work. takes place should be sterilised and passed into the area through double-ended sterilisers sealed into the wall, or by a procedure which achieves the same objective of not introducing contamination. Noncombustible gases should be passed through micro-organism retentive filters.
D. The efficacy of any new procedure should be validated, and the validation verified at scheduled intervals

based on performance history or when any significant change is made in the process or equipment.

## STERILISATION

E. All sterilisation processes should be validated. Particular attention should be given when the adopted sterilisation method is not described in the current edition of official compendia or when it is used for a product which is not a simple aqueous or oily solution. Where possible, heat sterilisation is the method of. authorisations.
F. Before any sterilisation process is adopted its suitability for the product and its efficacy in achieving the. desired sterilising conditions in all parts of each type of load to be processed should be demonstrated by. physical measurements and by biological indicators where appropriate. The validity of the process should. be verified at scheduled intervals, at least annually, and whenever significant modifications have been made to the equipment. Records should be kept of the results.
G. For effective sterilisation the whole of the material must be subjected to the required treatment and the process should be designed to ensure that this is achieved.
H. Validated loading patterns should be established for all sterilisation processes.

1. Biological indicators should be considered as an additional method for monitoring the sterilisation. They should be stored and used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and their quality checked by positive controls. If biological indicators are used, strict precautions should be taken to avoid transferring microbial contamination from them.

J. There should be a clear means of differentiating products which have not been sterilised from those which have. Each basket, tray or other carrier of products or components should be clearly labelled with the material name, its batch number and an indication of whether or not it has been sterilised. Indicators such as autoclave tape may be used, where appropriate, to indicate whether or not a batch (or sub-batch) has passed through a sterilisation process, but they do not give a reliable indication that the lot is, in fact, sterile. K. Sterilisation records should be available for each sterilisation run. They should be approved as part of the batch release procedure.

## STERILISATION BY HEAT

L. Each heat sterilisation cycle should be recorded on a time/temperature chart with a sufficiently large scale or by other appropriate equipment with suitable accuracy and precision. The position of the temperature probes used for controlling and/or recording should have been determined during the validation, and where applicable also checked against a second independent temperature probe located at the same position.

M. Chemical or biological indicators may also be used, but should not take the place of physical measurements.

N. Sufficient time must be allowed for the whole of the load to reach the required temperature before. measurement of the sterilising time-period is commenced. This time must be determined for each type of load to be processed.

O. After the high temperature phase of a heat sterilisation cycle, precautions should be taken against. contamination of a sterilised load during cooling. Any cooling fluid or gas in contact with the product should be sterilised unless it can be shown that any leaking container would not be approved for use..

## MOIST HEAT

P. Both temperature and pressure should be used to monitor the process. Control instrumentation should. normally be independent of monitoring instrumentation and recording charts. Where automated control and monitoring systems are used for these applications they should be validated to ensure that critical process. requirements are met. System and cycle faults should be registered by the system and observed by the. operator. The reading of the independent temperature indicator should be routinely checked against the chart recorder during the sterilisation period. For sterilisers fitted with a drain at the bottom of the chamber,. it may also be necessary to record the temperature at this position, throughout the sterilisation period. There should be frequent leak tests on the chamber when a vacuum phase is part of the cycle..

Q. The items to be sterilised, other than products in sealed containers, should be wrapped in a material.
which allows removal of air and penetration of steam but which prevents recontamination after sterilisation.
All parts of the load should be in contact with the sterilising agent at the required temperature for the.
required time.

R. Care should be taken to ensure that steam used for sterilisation is of suitable quality and does not contain additives at a level which could cause contamination of product or equipment.

## DRY HEAT

S. The process used should include air circulation within the chamber and the maintenance of a positive pressure to prevent the entry of non-sterile air. Any air admitted should be passed through a HEPA filter. Where this process is also intended to remove pyrogens, challenge tests using endotoxins should be used

## STERILISATION BY RADIATION

T. Radiation sterilisation is used mainly for the sterilisation of heat sensitive materials and products. Many. medicinal products and some packaging materials are radiation-sensitive, so this method is permissible. only when the absence of deleterious effects on the product has been confirmed experimentally. Ultraviolet irradiation is not normally an acceptable method of sterilisation.

U. During the sterilisation procedure the radiation dose should be measured. For this purpose, dosimetry. indicators which are independent of dose rate should be used, giving a quantitative measurement of the dose received by the product itself. Dosimeters should be inserted in the load in sufficient number and close enough together to ensure that there is always a dosimeter in the irradiator. Where plastic dosimeters are used they should be used within the time-limit of their calibration. Dosimeter absorbances should be read within a short period after exposure to radiation.

V. Biological indicators may be used as an additional control W. Validation procedures should ensure that the effects of variations in density of the packages are considered.

X. Materials handling procedures should prevent mix-up between irradiated and nonirradiated materials. Radiation sensitive colour disks should also be used on each package to differentiate between packages which have been subjected to irradiation and those which have not.

Y. The total radiation dose should be administered within a predetermined time span.

## STERILISATION WITH ETHYLENE OXIDE

Z. This method should only be used when no other method is practicable. During process validation it should be shown that there is no damaging effect on the product and that the conditions and time allowed for degassing are such as to reduce any residual gas and reaction products to defined acceptable limits for the type of product or material.

A. Direct contact between gas and microbial cells is essential; precautions should be taken to avoid the presence of organisms likely to be enclosed in material such as crystals or dried protein. The nature and. quantity of packaging materials can significantly affect the process.

B. Before exposure to the gas, materials should be brought into equilibrium with the humidity and temperature required by the process. The time required for this should be balanced against the opposing need to minimise the time before sterilisation.

C. Each sterilisation cycle should be monitored with suitable biological indicators, using the appropriate number of test pieces distributed throughout the load. The information so obtained should form part of the batch record.

D. For each sterilisation cycle, records should be made of the time taken to complete the cycle, of the pressure, temperature and humidity within the chamber during the process and of the gas concentration and. of the total amount of gas used. The pressure and temperature should be recorded throughout the cycle on a chart. The record(s) should form part of the batch record.

E. After sterilisation, the load should be stored in a controlled manner under ventilated conditions to allow residual gas and reaction products to reduce to the defined level. This process should be validated..

## FILTRATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS WHICH CANNOT BE STERILISED IN THEIR FINAL CONTAINER

F. Filtration alone is not considered sufficient when sterilisation in the final container is possible. With regard to methods currently available, steam sterilisation is to be preferred. If the product cannot be sterilised in the final container, solutions or liquids can be filtered through a sterile filter of nominal pore size of 0.22 micron (or less), or with at least equivalent micro-organism retaining properties, into a previously sterilised container. Such filters can remove most bacteria and moulds, but not all viruses or mycoplasmas. Consideration should be given to complementing the filtration process with some degree of heat treatment.

G. Due to the potential additional risks of the filtration method as compared with other sterilisation processes, a second filtration via a further sterilised microorganism retaining filter, immediately prior to filling, may be advisable. The final sterile filtration should be carried out as close as possible to the filling point.

H. Fibre-shedding characteristics of filters should be minimal.

1. The integrity of the sterilised filter should be verified before use and should be confirmed immediately. after use by an appropriate method such as a bubble point, diffusive flow or pressure hold test. The time. taken to filter a known volume of bulk solution and the pressure difference to be used across the filter should be determined during validation and any significant differences from this during routine. manufacturing should be noted and investigated. Results of these checks should be included in the batch record. The integrity of critical gas and air vent filters should be confirmed after use. The integrity of other. filters should be confirmed at appropriate intervals.

J. The same filter should not be used for more than one working day unless such use has been validated.

K. The filter should not affect the product by removal of ingredients from it or by release of substances into it.

## FINISHING OF STERILE PRODUCTS

L. Partially stoppered freeze drying vials should be maintained under Grade A conditions at all times until the stopper is fully inserted.
M. Containers should be closed by appropriately validated methods. Containers closed by fusion, e.g. glass or plastic ampoules should be subject to $100\%$ integrity testing. Samples of other containers should be. checked for integrity according to appropriate procedures.
N. The container closure system for aseptically filled vials is not fully integral until the aluminium cap has been crimped into place on the stoppered vial. Crimping of the cap should therefore be performed as soon as possible after stopper insertion.
O. As the equipment used to crimp vial caps can generate large quantities of nonviable particulates, the equipment should be located at a separate station equipped with adequate air extraction.
P. Vial capping can be undertaken as an aseptic process using sterilised caps or as a clean process outside the aseptic core. Where this latter approach is adopted, vials should be protected by Grade A conditions up to the point of leaving the aseptic processing area, and thereafter stoppered vials should be protected with. a Grade A air supply until the cap has been crimped..
Q. Vials with missing or displaced stoppers should be rejected prior to capping. Where human intervention. is required at the capping station, appropriate technology should be used to prevent direct contact with the vials and to minimise microbial contamination.
R. Restricted access barriers and isolators may be beneficial in assuring the required conditions and minimising direct human interventions into the capping operation.
S. Containers sealed under vacuum should be tested for maintenance of that vacuum after an appropriate, pre-determined period.
T. Filled containers of parenteral products should be inspected individually for extraneous contamination or other defects. When inspection is done visually, it should be done under suitable and controlled conditions of illumination and background. Operators doing the inspection should pass regular eye-sight checks, with spectacles if worn, and be allowed frequent breaks from inspection. Where other methods of inspection are used, the process should be validated and the performance of the equipment checked at intervals. Results should be recorded.

## QUALITY CONTROL

U. The sterility test applied to the finished product should only be regarded as the last in a series of control measures by which sterility is assured. The test should be validated for the product(s) concerned.

V. In those cases where parametric release has been authorised, special attention should be paid to the validation and the monitoring of the entire manufacturing process.

W. Samples taken for sterility testing should be representative of the whole of the batch, but should in particular include samples taken from parts of the batch considered to be most at risk of contamination, e. g.:

a) for products which have been filled aseptically, samples should include containers filled at the beginning and end of the batch and after any significant intervention; For radiopharmaceuticals,. however, sampling could be adjusted according to the purpose of collecting, the type of control applied or the characteristics (e.g. small batch or content of radiation) of the materials to be. collected.

b) for products which have been heat sterilised in their final containers, consideration should be given to taking samples from the potentially coolest part of the load.

# MANUFACTURE OF BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL SUBSTANCES AND PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE

## SCOPE

The methods employed in the manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products are a critical factor in shaping the appropriate regulatory control. Biological medicinal substances and products can be defined therefore largely by reference to their method of manufacture. This annex provides guidance on the full range of medicinal substances and products defined as biological.

This annex is divided into two main parts:

a) Part A contains supplementary guidance on the manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products, from control over seed lots and cell banks or starting material through to finishing activities and testing.

b) Part B contains further guidance on selected types of biological medicinal substances and products.

This annex, along with several other annexes of the Guide to GMP, provides guidance which supplements that in Annex 1 and Annex 3 of the Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products,. etc. and Annex 15 of this Guide. There are two aspects to the scope of this annex:.

a) Stage of manufacture - for biological active substances to the point immediately prior to their being rendered sterile, the primary guidance source is Annex 15 of this guide. Guidance for the subsequent manufacturing steps of biological products are covered in Annex 1 and, if applicable, Annex 3 of the Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc. For some types of product (e.g. Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP) cell-based products) all manufacturing steps need to be conducted aseptically. b) Type of product - this annex provides guidance on the full range of medicinal substances and products defined as biological.

These two aspects are shown in Table 1; it should be noted that this table is illustrative only and is not meant to describe the precise scope. It should also be understood that in line with the corresponding table in Annex 15 of the Guide, the level of GMP increases in detail from early to later steps in the manufacture of biological substances but GMP principles should. always be adhered to. The inclusion of some early steps of manufacture within the scope of the annex does not imply that those steps will be routinely subject to inspection by the. authorities. Antibiotics are not defined or included as biological products, however where biological stages of manufacture occur, guidance in this Annex may be used. Guidance for. medicinal products derived from fractionated human blood or plasma is covered in Annex 12 and for non-transgenic plant products in Annex 5.

In certain cases, other legislation may be applicable to the starting materials for biologicals: a) For tissue and cells used for industrially manufactured products (such as pharmaceuticals), the donation, procurement and testing of tissue and cells may be covered by national legislation. b) Where blood or blood components are used as starting materials for ATMPs, national legislation may provide the technical requirements for the selection of donors and the collection and testing of blood and blood components. c) The manufacture and control of genetically modified organisms needs to comply with local and national requirements. Appropriate containment should be established and maintained in facilities where any genetically modified micro-organism is handled. Advice should be obtained according to national legislation in order to establish and maintain the appropriate Biological Safety Level including measures to prevent cross contamination. There should be no conflicts with GMP requirements.

## PRINCIPLE

The manufacture of biological medicinal products involves certain specific considerations arising from the nature of the products and the processes. The ways in which biological medicinal products are manufactured, controlled and administered make some particular precautions necessary.

Unlike conventional medicinal products, which are manufactured using chemical and physical techniques capable of a high degree of consistency, the manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products involves biological processes and materials, such as cultivation of cells or extraction of material from living organisms. These biological processes may display inherent variability, so that the range and nature of by-products may. be variable. As a result, quality risk management (QRM) principles are particularly important for this class of materials and should be used to develop their control strategy across all stages of manufacture so as to minimise variability and to reduce the opportunity for contamination and cross-contamination.

Since materials and processing conditions used in cultivation processes are designed to provide conditions for the growth of specific cells and microorganisms, this provides extraneous microbial contaminants the opportunity to grow. In addition, many products are limited in their ability to withstand a wide range of purification techniques particularly those designed to inactivate or remove adventitious viral contaminants. The design of the processes, equipment, facilities, utilities, the conditions of preparation and addition of buffers and reagents, sampling and training of the operators are key considerations to minimise such contamination events.

Specifications related to products (such as those in Pharmacopoeial monographs, Marketing. Authorisation (MA), and Clinical Trial Authorisation (CTA)) will dictate whether and to what stage substances and materials can have a defined level of bioburden or need to be sterile. For biological materials that cannot be sterilized (e.g. by filtration), processing must be conducted aseptically to minimise the introduction of contaminants. The application of appropriate environmental controls and monitoring and, wherever feasible, in-situ cleaning. and sterilization systems together with the use of closed systems can significantly reduce the risk of accidental contamination and cross-contamination..

Control usually involves biological analytical techniques, which typically have a greater variability than physico-chemical determinations. A robust manufacturing process is. therefore crucial and in-process controls take on a particular importance in the manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products.

Biological medicinal products which incorporate human tissues or cells, such as certain ATMPs must comply with national requirements for the donation, procurement and testing stages. Collection and testing of this material must be done in accordance with an appropriate quality system and in accordance with

applicable national requirements Furthermore, national requirements on traceability apply from the donor (while maintaining donor confidentiality) through stages applicable at the Tissue Establishment and then continued under medicines legislation through to the institution where the product is used.

Biological medicinal substances and products must comply with the applicable national guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products.

## PART A. GENERAL GUIDANCE PERSONNEL

### PERSONNEL

X. Personnel (including those concerned with cleaning, maintenance or quality control) employed in areas where biological medicinal products are manufactured and tested should receive training, and periodic retraining, specific to the products manufactured and to their work, including any specific measures to protect product, personnel and the environment.

Y. The health status of personnel should be taken into consideration for product safety. Where necessary, personnel engaged in production, maintenance, testing and animal care (and inspections) should be vaccinated with appropriate specific vaccines and have regular health checks.

Z. Any changes in the health status of personnel, which could adversely affect the quality of. the product, should preclude work in the production area and appropriate records kept. Production of BCG vaccine and tuberculin products should be restricted to staff who are. carefully monitored by regular checks of immunological status or chest X-ray. Health monitoring of staff should be commensurate with the risk, medical advice should be sought for personnel involved with hazardous organisms..

A. Where required to minimise the opportunity for cross-contamination, restrictions on the movement of all personnel (including QC, maintenance and cleaning staff) should be controlled on the basis of QRM principles. In general, personnel should not pass from areas where exposure to live micro-organisms, genetically modified organisms, toxins or animals. to areas where other products, inactivated products or different organisms are handled. If. such passage is unavoidable, the contamination control measures should be based on QRM principles.

### PREMISE AND EQUIPMENT

B. As part of the control strategy, the degree of environmental control of particulate and microbial contamination of the production premises should be adapted to the product and the production step, bearing in mind the level of contamination of the starting materials and the. risks to the product. The environmental monitoring programme in addition to Annex 1 should be supplemented by the inclusion of methods to detect the presence of specific. microorganisms (e.g. host organism, anaerobes, etc) where indicated by the QRM process. C. Manufacturing and storage facilities, processes and environmental classifications should be designed to prevent the extraneous contamination of products. Although contamination is likely to become evident during processes such as fermentation and cell culture, prevention of contamination is more appropriate than detection and removal. In fact, the environmental monitoring and material bioburden testing programs are intended to verify a state of control. Where processes are not closed and there is therefore exposure of the product to the immediate room environment (e.g. during additions of supplements, media, buffers, gasses, manipulations during the manufacture of ATMPs) measures should be put in place, including. engineering and environmental controls on the basis of QRM principles. These QRM principles should take into account the principles and requirements from the appropriate sections of Annex 1 when selecting environmental classification cascades and associated controls.

D. Dedicated production areas should be used for the handling of live cells, capable of persistence in the manufacturing environment, until inactivation. Dedicated production area should be used for the manufacture of pathogenic organisms capable of causing severe human disease.

E. Manufacture in a multi-product facility may be acceptable where the following, or. equivalent (as appropriate to the product types involved) considerations and measures are part of an effective control strategy to prevent cross-contamination using QRM principles:

a) Knowledge of key characteristics of all cells, organisms and any adventitious agents (e.g. pathogenicity, detectability, persistence, susceptibility to inactivation) within the same facility.
b) Where production is characterised by multiple small batches from different starting materials (e.g. cell-based products), factors such as the health status of donors and the risk of total loss of product from and/or for specific patients should be taken into account when considering the acceptance of concurrent working during development of the control strategy.
c) Live organisms and spores (where relevant) are prevented from entering non-related areas or equipment. Control measures to remove the organisms and spores before the subsequent manufacture of other products, these control measures should also take the HVAC system into account. Cleaning and decontamination for the removal of the. organisms and spores should be validated.
d) Environmental monitoring, specific for the micro-organism being manufactured, is also conducted in adjacent areas during manufacture and after completion of cleaning and decontamination. Attention should also be given to risks arising with use of certain monitoring equipment(e.g. airborne particle monitoring) in areas handling live and/or spore forming organisms.
e) Products, equipment, ancillary equipment (e.g. for calibration and validation) and disposable items are only moved within and removed from such areas in a manner that prevents contamination of other areas, other products and different product stages (e.g.. prevent contamination of inactivated or toxoided products with non-inactivated products).
f) Campaign-based manufacturing followed by validated cleaning and decontamination procedures.

F. For finishing operations , the need for dedicated facilities will depend on consideration of. the above together with additional considerations such as the specific needs of the biological product and on the characteristics of other products, including any non-biological products,. in the same facility. Other control measures for finishing operations may include the need for.

specific addition sequences, mixing speeds, time and temperature controls, limits on exposure to light and containment and cleaning procedures in the event of spillages.

G. The measures and procedures necessary for containment (i.e. for environment and operator safety) should not conflict with those for product safety..

H. Air handling units should be designed, constructed and maintained to minimise the risk. of cross-contamination between different manufacturing areas and may need to be specific for an area. Consideration, based on QRM principles, should be given to the use of single pass air systems.

1. Positive pressure areas should be used to process sterile products but negative pressure in specific areas at the point of exposure of pathogens is acceptable for containment reasons. Where negative pressure areas or safety cabinets are used for aseptic processing of materials with particular risks (e.g. pathogens), they should be surrounded by a positive pressure clean zone of appropriate grade. These pressure cascades should be clearly defined and continuously monitored with appropriate alarm settings.

J. Equipment used during handling of live organisms and cells, including those for sampling, should be designed to prevent any contamination of the live organism or cell during processing.

K. Primary containment should be designed and periodically tested to ensure the prevention of escape of biological agents into the immediate working environment.

L. The use of'clean in place' and 'steam in place' ('sterilisation in place') systems should be used where possible. Valves on fermentation vessels should be completely steam sterilisable. M. Air vent filters should be hydrophobic and validated for their scheduled life span with integrity testing at appropriate intervals based on appropriate QRM principles.

N. Drainage systems must be designed so that effluents can be effectively neutralised or decontaminated to minimise the risk of cross-contamination. Compliance with local regulations is required to minimize the risk of contamination of the external environment according to the risk associated with the biohazardous nature of waste materials.

O. Due to the variability of biological products or processes, relevant/critical additives or ingredients may have to be measured or weighed during the production process. In these cases, stocks of these substances may be kept in the production area for a specified duration based on defined criteria such as for the duration of manufacture of the batch or of the campaign. Materials must be stored appropriately.

### ANIMALS

P. A wide range of animal species are used in the manufacture of a number of biological medicinal products or starting materials. These can be divided into 2 broad types of sources:

a) Live groups, herds, flocks: examples include polio vaccine (monkeys), immunosera to snake venoms and tetanus (horses, sheep and goats), allergens (cats), rabies vaccine (rabbits, mice and hamsters), transgenic products (goats, cattle).
b) Animal tissues and cells derived post-mortem and from establishments such as abattoirs: examples include xenogeneic cells from animal tissues and cells, feeder cells to support the growth of some ATMPs, abattoir sources for enzymes, anticoagulants and hormones (sheep and pigs). In addition, animals may also be used in quality control either in generic assays, e.g.

pyrogenicity, or specific potency assays, e.g. pertussis vaccine (mice), pyrogenicity (rabbits), BCG vaccine (guinea-pigs).

Q. In addition to compliance with TSE regulations, other adventitious agents that are of concern (zoonotic diseases, diseases of source animals) should be monitored by an ongoing health programme and recorded. Specialist advice should be obtained in establishing such programmes. Instances of ill-health occurring in the source animals should be investigated with respect to their suitability and the suitability of in-contact animals for continued use (in manufacture, as sources of starting materials, in quality control and safety testing), the decisions must be documented. A look-back procedure should be in place which informs the decision making process on the continued suitability of the medicinal substance(s) or product(s) in which the materials have been used or incorporated. This decision-making process may include the re-testing of retained samples from previous collections from the same donor (where applicable) to establish the last negative donation. The withdrawal period of therapeutic agents used to treat source animals must be documented and used to determine the removal of those animals from the programme for defined periods.

R. Particular care should be taken to prevent and monitor infections in the source / donor animals. Measures should include the sourcing, facilities, husbandry, biosecurity procedures, testing regimes, control of bedding and feed materials. This is of special relevance to. specified pathogen free animals where pharmacopoeial monograph requirements must be. met. Housing and health monitoring should be defined for other categories of animals (e.g. healthy flocks or herds).

S. For products manufactured from transgenic animals, traceability should be maintained in the creation of such animals from the source animals.
T. Note should be taken of national requirements for animal quarters, care and quarantine Housing for animals used in production and control of biological products should be separated from production and control areas.
U. For different animal species, key criteria should be defined, monitored, and recorded. These may include age, weight and health status of the animals.
V. Animals, biological agents, and tests carried out should be appropriately identified to prevent any risk of mix up and to control all identified hazards.

### DOCUMENTATION

W. Specifications for biological starting materials may need additional documentation on the source, origin, distribution chain, method of manufacture, and controls applied, to assure an appropriate level of control including their microbiological quality.

X. Some product types may require specific definition of what materials constitutes a batch, particularly somatic cells in the context of ATMPs. For autologous and donor-matched situations, the manufactured product should be viewed as a batch..

Y. Where human cell or tissue donors are used, full traceability is required from starting and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the cells or tissues through to confirmation of the receipt of the products at the point of use whilst maintaining the privacy of individuals and confidentiality of health related information. Traceability records must be retained for 30 years after the expiry date of the product. Particular care should be taken to maintain the traceability of products for special use cases, such as donor-matched cells. National requirements apply to blood components when they are used as supportive or raw material in the manufacturing process of medicinal products. For ATMPs, traceability. requirement regarding human cells including haematopoietic cells must comply with the principles laid down in national legislation. The arrangements necessary to achieve the. traceability and retention period should be incorporated into technical agreements between the responsible parties.

### PRODUCTION

Z. Given the variability inherent in many biological substances and products, steps to increase process robustness thereby reducing process variability and enhancing. reproducibility at the different stages of the product lifecycle such as process design should be reassessed during Product Quality Reviews.

A. Since cultivation conditions, media and reagents are designed to promote the growth of cells or microbial organisms, typically in an axenic state, particular attention should be paid in the control strategy to ensure there are robust steps that prevent or minimise the occurrence of unwanted bioburden and associated metabolites and endotoxins. For cell based ATMPs where production batches are frequently small the risk of cross-contamination between cell preparations from different donors with various health status should be controlled under defined procedures and requirements.

### STARTING MATERIALS

B. The source, origin and suitability of biological starting and raw materials (e.g.. cryoprotectants, feeder cells, reagents, culture media, buffers, serum, enzymes, cytokines,. growth factors) should be clearly defined. Where the necessary tests take a long time, it may. be permissible to process starting materials before the results of the tests are available, the risk of using a potentially failed material and its potential impact on other batches should be clearly understood and assessed under the principles of QRM. In such cases, release of a finished product is conditional on satisfactory results of these tests. The identification of all starting materials should be in compliance with the requirements appropriate to its stage of. manufacture.

C. The risk of contamination of starting materials during their passage along the supply chain. must be assessed, with particular emphasis on TSE. Materials that come into direct contact with manufacturing equipment or the product (such as media used in media fill experiments and lubricants that may contact the product) must also be taken into account..

D. Given that the risks from the introduction of contamination and the consequences to the product is the same irrespective of the stage of manufacture, establishment of a control strategy to protect the product and the preparation of solutions, buffers and other additions should be based on the principles and guidance contained in the appropriate sections of Annex 1. The controls required for the quality of starting materials and on the aseptic manufacturing process, particularly for cell-based products, where final sterilisation is generally not possible and the ability to remove microbial by-products is limited, assume greater importance. Where an MA or CTA provides for an allowable type and level of bioburden, for example at active substance stage, the control strategy should address the means by which this is maintained within the specified limits.

E. Where sterilization of starting materials is required, it should be carried out where possible by heat. Where necessary, other appropriate methods may also be used for inactivation of biological materials (e.g. irradiation and filtration).

F. Reduction in bioburden associated with procurement of living tissues and cells may. require the use of other measures such as antibiotics at early manufacturing stages. This should be avoided, but where it is necessary their use should be justified and carefully controlled, they should be removed from the manufacturing process at the stage specified in the MA or CTA. Where antibiotics are used, the suitability of the use should be verified, and in general, due to the possibility of causing resistant strains, the antibiotics used for humans should be avoided. In addition, using antibiotics is not effective in controlling microbial contamination.

G. For human tissues and cells used as starting materials for biological medicinal products:

a) Their procurement, donation and testing is regulated in some countries. Such supply sites must hold appropriate approvals from the national competent authority(ies) which should be verified as part of starting material supplier management.
b) Where such human cells or tissues are imported they must meet equivalent national standards of quality and safety. The traceability and serious adverse reaction and serious adverse event notification requirements may be set out in national legislation.
c) There may be some instances where processing of cells and tissues used as starting materials for biological medicinal products will be conducted at tissue establishments, e.g. to derive early cell lines or banks prior to establishing a Master Cell Bank, MCB.
d) Tissue and cells are released by the Responsible Person in the tissue establishment before shipment to the medicinal product manufacturer, after which normal medicinal product starting material controls apply. The test results of all tissues / cells supplied by the tissue establishment should be available to the manufacturer of the medicinal product. Such information must be used to make appropriate material segregation and storage decisions. In cases where manufacturing must be initiated prior to receiving test results from the tissue establishment, tissue and cells may be shipped to the medicinal product manufacturer provided controls are in place to prevent crosscontamination with tissue and cells that have been released by the RP in the tissue establishment.
e) The transport of human tissues and cells to the manufacturing site must be controlled by a written agreement between the responsible parties. The manufacturing sites should have documentary evidence of adherence to the specified storage and transport conditions.
f) Continuation of traceability requirements started at tissue establishments through to the recipient(s), and vice versa, including materials in contact with the cells or tissues, should be maintained.
g) A technical agreement should be in place between the responsible parties (e.g. manufacturers, tissue establishment, Sponsors, MA Holder) which defines responsibilities of each party, including the RP..

H. With regard to gene therapy:

a) For products consisting of viral vectors, the starting materials are the components from which the viral vector is obtained, i.e. the master virus seed or the plasmids to transfect. the packaging cells and the MCB of the packaging cell line..
b) For products consisting of plasmids, non-viral vectors and genetically modified micro-. organisms other than viruses or viral vectors, the starting materials are the. components used to generate the producing cell, i.e. the plasmid, the host bacteria and the MCB of the recombinant microbial cells.
c) For genetically modified cells, the starting materials are the components used to obtain the genetically modified cells, i.e. the starting materials to manufacture the vector and the human or animal cell preparations.
d) The principles of GMP apply from the bank system used to manufacture the vector or plasmid used for gene transfer.

I. Where human or animal cells are used in the manufacturing process as feeder cells, appropriate controls over the sourcing, testing, transport and storage should be in place, including compliance with national requirements for human cells.

### SEED LOT AND CELL BANK SYSTEM

J. In order to prevent the unwanted drift of properties which might ensue from repeated subcultures or multiple generations, the production of biological medicinal substances and products obtained by microbial culture, cell culture or propagation in embryos and animals should be based on a system of master and working virus seed lots and/or cell banks. Such a system may not be applicable to all types of ATMPs.

K. The number of generations (doublings, passages) between the seed lot or cell bank, the. drug substance and finished product should be consistent with specifications in the MA or CTA.

L. As part of product lifecycle management, establishment of seed lots and cell banks, including master and working generations, should be performed under circumstances which. are demonstrably appropriate. This should include an appropriately controlled environment to protect the seed lot and the cell bank and the personnel handling it. During the establishment of the seed lot and cell bank, no other living or infectious material (e.g. virus, cell lines or cell strains) should be handled simultaneously in the same area or by the same persons. For stages prior to the master seed or cell bank generation, where only the principles of GMP may be applied, documentation should be available to support traceability including. issues related to components used during development with potential impact on product safety (e.g. reagents of biological origin) from initial sourcing and genetic development if applicable. For vaccines the requirements of pharmacopoeial monographs will apply.

M. Following the establishment of master and working cell banks and master and working seed lots, quarantine and release procedures should be followed. This should include adequate characterization and testing for contaminants. Their on-going suitability for use should be further demonstrated by the consistency of the characteristics and quality of the successive batches of product. Evidence of the stability and recovery of the seeds and banks should be documented and records should be kept in a manner permitting trend evaluation.

N. Seed lots and cell banks should be stored and used in such a way as to minimize the risks of contamination or alteration (e.g. stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen in sealed containers). Control measures for the storage of different seeds and/or cells in the same area or equipment should prevent mix-up and take into account the infectious nature of the materials to prevent cross contamination.

O. Cell based medicinal products are often generated from a cell stock obtained from limited number of passages. In contrast with the two tiered system of Master and Working cell banks, the number of production runs from a cell stock is limited by the number of aliquots obtained after expansion and does not cover the entire life cycle of the product. Cell stock changes should be covered by a validation protocol.

P. Storage containers should be sealed, clearly labelled and kept at an appropriate temperature. A stock inventory must be kept. The storage temperature should be recorded continuously and, where used, the liquid nitrogen level monitored. Deviation from set limits and corrective and preventive action taken should be recorded.

Q. It is desirable to split stocks and to store the split stocks at different locations so as to minimize the risks of total loss. The controls at such locations should provide the assurances outlined in the preceding paragraphs.

R. The storage and handling conditions for stocks should be managed according to the same procedures and parameters. Once containers are removed from the seed lot / cell bank management system, the containers should not be returned to stock..

### OPERATING PRINCIPLES

S. Change management should, on a periodic basis, take into account the effects, including cumulative effects of changes (e.g. to the process) on the quality of the final product.

T. Critical operational (process) parameters, or other input parameters which affect product quality, need to be identified, validated, documented and be shown to be maintained within requirements.

U. A control strategy for the entry of articles and materials into production areas should be based on QRM principles to minimise the risk of contamination. For aseptic processes, heat stable articles and materials entering a clean area or clean/contained area should preferably do so through a double-ended autoclave or oven. Heat labile articles and materials should enter through an air lock with interlocked doors where they are subject to effective surface sanitisation procedures. Sterilisation of articles and materials elsewhere is acceptable. provided that they are multiple wrappings, as appropriate to the number of stages of entry to. the clean area, and enter through an airlock with the appropriate surface sanitisation. precautions.

V. The growth promoting properties of culture media should be demonstrated to be suitable. for its intended use. If possible, media should be sterilized in situ. Inline sterilizing filters for routine addition of gases, media, acids or alkalis, anti-foaming agents etc. to fermenters should be used where possible.

W. Addition of materials or cultures to fermenters and other vessels and sampling should be carried out under carefully controlled conditions to prevent contamination. Care should be taken to ensure that vessels are correctly connected when addition or sampling takes place.

X. Continuous monitoring of some production processes (e.g. fermentation) may be. necessary; such data should form part of the batch record. Where continuous culture is used, special consideration should be given to the quality control requirements arising from this. type of production method.

Y. Centrifugation and blending of products can lead to aerosol formation and containment of such activities to minimise cross-contamination is necessary.

Z. Accidental spillages, especially of live organisms, must be dealt with quickly and safely. Validated decontamination measures should be available for each organism or groups of related organisms. Where different strains of single bacteria species or very similar viruses are involved, the decontamination process may be validated with one representative strain,

unless there is reason to believe that they may vary significantly in their resistance to the agent(s) involved.
A. If obviously contaminated, such as by spills or aerosols, or if a potentially hazardous organism is involved, production and control materials, including paperwork, must be adequately disinfected, or the information transferred out by other means.
validated.
C. In cases where a virus inactivation or removal process is performed during manufacture, measures should be taken to avoid the risk of recontamination of treated products by nontreated products.
D. For products that are inactivated by the addition of a reagent (e.g. micro-organisms in the course of vaccine manufacture) the process should ensure the complete inactivation of live organism. In addition to the thorough mixing of culture and inactivant, consideration should be given to contact of all product-contact surfaces exposed to live culture and, where required, the transfer to a second vessel.
E. A wide variety of equipment is used for chromatography. QRM principles should be used to devise the control strategy on matrices, the housings and associated equipment when used in campaign manufacture and in multi-product environments. The re-use of the same matrix at different stages of processing is discouraged. Acceptance criteria, operating conditions, regeneration methods, life span and sanitization or sterilization methods of columns should be defined.
F. Where ionising radiation is used in the manufacture of medicinal products, Annex 10 should be consulted for further guidance.
G. There should be a system to assure the integrity and closure of containers after filling where the final products or intermediates represent a special risk and procedures to deal with any leaks or spillages. Filling and packaging operations need to have procedures in place to. maintain the product within any specified limits, e.g. time and/or temperature..
H. Activities in handling containers, which have live biological agents, must be performed in such a way to prevent the contamination of other products or egress of the live agents into consideration the viability of such organisms and their biological classification.
I. Care should be taken in the preparation, printing, storage and application of labels, including any specific text for patient-specific products or signifying the use of genetic engineering of the contents on the primary container and secondary packaging. In the case of products used for autologous use, the unique patient identifier and the statement for autologous use only"' should be indicated on the immediate label.
J. The compatibility of labels with ultra-low storage temperatures, where such temperatures are used, should be verified.
K. Where donor and/or animal health information becomes available after procurement,

which affects product quality, it should be taken into account in recall procedures.

### QUALITY CONTROL

L. In-process controls have a greater importance in ensuring the consistency of the quality of biological medicinal products than for conventional products. In-process control testing should be performed at appropriate stages of production to control those conditions that are important for the quality of the finished product.

M. Where intermediates can be stored for extended periods of time (days, weeks or longer), consideration should be given to the inclusion of final product batches made from materials held for their maximum in-process periods in the on-going stability programme.

N. Certain types of cells (e.g. autologous cells used in ATMPs) may be available in limited quantities and, where allowed in the MA or CTA, a modified testing and sample retention. strategy may be developed and documented.

O. For cell-based ATMPs, sterility tests should be conducted on antibiotic-free cultures of cells or cell banks to provide evidence for absence of bacterial and fungal contamination and to be able to detection fastidious organisms where appropriate..

P. For products with a short shelf life, which need batch certification before completion of all end product quality control tests (e.g. sterility tests) a suitable control strategy must be in place. Such controls need to be built on enhanced understanding of product and process performance and take into account the controls and attributes of input materials. The exact and detailed description of the entire release procedure, including the responsibilities of the different personnel involved in assessment of production and analytical data is essential. A continuous assessment of the effectiveness of the quality assurance system must be in place including records kept in a manner which permit trend evaluation. Where end product tests are not possible due to their short shelf life, alternative methods of obtaining equivalent data to permit batch certification should be considered (e.g. rapid microbiological methods). The procedure for batch certification and release may be carried out in two or more stages - before and after full end process analytical test results are available:

Assessment by designated person(s) of batch processing records and results from environmental monitoring (where available) which should cover production conditions, all deviations from normal procedures and the available analytical results for review and conditional certification by the Responsible Person.
Assessment of the final analytical tests and other information available before end product dispatch for final product certification by the Responsible Person.
A procedure should be in place to describe the measures to be taken (including liaison with clinical staff) where out of specification test results are obtained after product dispatch. Such events should be fully investigated and the relevant corrective and preventative actions taken to prevent recurrence documented.
A procedure should describe those measures which will be taken by the Responsible
Person if unsatisfactory test results are obtained after dispatch.

## PART B. SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON SELECTED PRODUCT TYPES

### B1. ANIMAL SOURCED PRODUCTS

This guidance applies to animal materials which includes materials from establishments such as abattoirs. Since the supply chains can be extensive and complex, controls based on QRM principles need to be applied, see also requirements of appropriate pharmacopoeial monographs, including the need for specific tests at defined stages. Documentation to demonstrate the supply chain traceability and clear roles of participants in the supply chain, typically including a sufficiently detailed and current process map, should be in place.

1. Monitoring programmes should be in place for animal disease that are of concern to human health. Organisations should take into account reports from trustworthy sources on national disease prevalence and control measures when compiling their assessment of risk and mitigation factors. Such organisations include the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE, Office International des Epizooties). This should be supplemented by information on health monitoring and control programme(s) at national and local levels,. the latter to include the sources (e.g. farm or feedlot) from which the animals are drawn and the control measures in place during transport to the abattoirs..

2. Where abattoirs are used to source animal tissues, they should be shown to operate to stringent standards. Account should be taken of reports from national regulatory. organisations which verify compliance with the requirements of food, safety, quality and. veterinary and plant health legislation..

3. Control measures for the pharmaceutical raw materials at establishments such as abattoirs should include appropriate elements of Quality Management System to assure a satisfactory level of operator training, materials traceability, control and consistency. These measures may be drawn from sources outside PIC/S GMP but should be shown to provide equivalent levels of control.

4. Control measures for materials should be in place which prevent interventions which may. affect the quality of materials, or which at least provides evidence of such activities, during. their progression through the manufacturing and supply chain. This includes the. movement of material between sites of initial collection, partial and final purification(s),. storage sites, hubs, consolidators and brokers. Details of such arrangements should be recorded within the traceability system and any breaches recorded, investigated and actions taken.

5. Regular audits of the raw material supplier should be undertaken which verify compliance. with controls for materials at the different stages of manufacture. Issues must be. investigated to a depth appropriate to their significance, for which full documentation. should be available. Systems should also be in place to ensure that effective corrective and preventive actions are taken.

6. Cells, tissues and organs intended for the manufacture of xenogeneic cell- based medicinal products should be obtained only from animals that have been bred in captivity (barrier facility) specifically for this purpose and under no circumstances should cells, tissues and organs from wild animals or from abattoirs be used. Tissues of founder animals similarly should not be used. The health status of the animals should be monitored and documented.

7. For xenogeneic cell therapy products appropriate guidance in relation to procurement and testing of animal cells should be followed.

### B2. ALLERGEN PRODUCTS

Materials may be manufactured by extraction from natural sources or manufactured by recombinant DNA technology.

8. Source materials should be described in sufficient detail to ensure consistency in their supply, e.g. common and scientific name, origin, nature, contaminant limits, method of collection. Those derived from animals should be from healthy sources. Appropriate.

biosecurity controls should be in place for colonies (e.g. mites, animals) used for the extraction of allergens. Allergen should be stored under defined conditions to minimise

deterioration.
9. The production process steps including pre-treatment, extraction, filtration, dialysis, concentration or freeze-drying steps should be described in detail and validated.
10. The modification processes to manufacture modified allergen extracts (e.g. allergoids, conjugates) should be described. Intermediates in the manufacturing process should be identified and controlled.
11. Allergen extract mixtures should be prepared from individual extracts from single source. materials. Each individual extract should be considered as one active substance.

### B3. ANIMAL IMMUNOSERA PRODUCTS

12. Particular care should be exercised on the control of antigens of biological origin to assure their quality, consistency and freedom from adventitious agents. The preparation of materials used to immunise the source animals (e.g. antigens, hapten carriers, adjuvants, stabilising agents), the storage of such material immediately prior to immunisation should be in accordance with documented procedures.
13. The immunisation, test bleed and harvest bleed schedules should conform to those approved in the CTA or MA.
14. The manufacturing conditions for the preparation of antibody sub-fragments (e.g. Fab or F(ab')2) and any further modifications must be in accordance with validated and approved parameters. Where such enzymes are made up of several components, their consistency should be assured.

### B4. VACCINES

15. Where eggs are used, the health status of all source flocks used in the production of eggs (whether specified pathogen free or healthy flocks) should be assured.
16. The integrity of containers used to store intermediate product and the hold times must be validated.
17. Vessels containing inactivated product should not be opened or sampled in areas containing live biological agents.
18. The sequence of addition of active ingredients, adjuvants and excipients during the formulation of an intermediate or final product must be in compliance with the manufacturing instructions or the batch record.
19. Where organisms with a higher biological safety level (e.g. pandemic vaccine strains) are to be used in manufacture or testing, appropriate containment arrangements must be in place. The approval of such arrangements should be obtained from the appropriate national authority(ies) and the approval documents be available for verification.

### B5. RECOMBINANT PRODUCTS

20. Process condition during cell growth, protein expression and purification must be. maintained within validated parameters to assure a consistent product with a defined range. of impurities that is within the capability of the process to reduce to acceptable levels. The type of cell used in production may require increased measures to be taken to assure. freedom from viruses. For production involving multiple harvests, the period of.

continuous cultivation should be within specified limits.

21. The purification processes to remove unwanted host cell proteins, nucleic acids,. carbohydrates, viruses and other impurities should be within defined validated limits.

### B6. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PRODUCTS

22.Monoclonal antibodies may be manufactured from murine hybridomas, human hybridomas or by recombinant DNA technology. Control measures appropriate to the. different source cells (including feeder cells if used) and materials used to establish the hybridoma / cell line should be in place to assure the safety and quality of the product. It should be verified that these are within approved limits. Freedom from viruses should be given particular emphasis. It should be noted that data originating from products generated by the same manufacturing technology platform may be acceptable to demonstrate suitability.

23. Criteria to be monitored at the end of a production cycle and for early termination of production cycle should be verified that these are within approved limits..

24. The manufacturing conditions for the preparation of antibody sub-fragments (e.g. Fab, F(ab')2, scFv) and any further modifications (e.g. radio labelling, conjugation, chemical linking) must be in accordance with validated parameters.

### B7. TRANSGENIC ANIMAL PRODUCTS

Consistency of starting material from a transgenic source is likely to be more problematic than is normally the case for non-transgenic biotechnology sources. Consequently, there is an increased requirement to demonstrate batch-to-batch consistency of product in all respects.

25. A range of species may be used to produce biological medicinal products, which may be expressed into body fluids (e.g. milk) for collection and purification. Animals should be clearly and uniquely identified and backup arrangements should be put in place in the event of loss of the primary marker.
26. The arrangements for housing and care of the animals should be defined such that they minimise the exposure of the animals to pathogenic and zoonotic agents. Appropriate measures to protect the external environment should be established. A health-monitoring programme should be established and all results documented, any incident should be investigated and its impact on the continuation of the animal and on previous batches of product should be determined. Care should be taken to ensure that any therapeutic products used to treat the animals do not contaminate the product.
27. The genealogy of the founder animals through to production animals must be documented. Since a transgenic line will be derived from a single genetic founder animal, materials from different transgenic lines should not be mixed.
28. The conditions under which the product is harvested should be in accordance with MA or CTA conditions. The harvest schedule and conditions under which animals may be removed from production should be performed according to approved procedures and acceptance limits.

### B8. TRANSGENIC PLANT PRODUCTS

Consistency of starting material from a transgenic source is likely to be more problematic than is normally the case for non-transgenic biotechnology sources. Consequently, there is an increased requirement to demonstrate batch-to-batch consistency of product in all respects.

29. Additional measures, over and above those given in Part A, may be required to prevent contamination of master and working transgenic banks by extraneous plant materials and relevant adventitious agents. The stability of the gene within defined generation numbers. should be monitored.

30. Plants should be clearly and uniquely identified, the presence of key plant features, including health status, across the crop should be verified at defined intervals through the cultivation period to assure consistency of yield between crops.

31. Security arrangements for the protection of crops should be defined, wherever possible, such that they minimise the exposure to contamination by microbiological agents and cross-contamination with non-related plants. Measures should be in place to prevent materials such as pesticides and fertilisers from contaminating the product. A monitoring programme should be established and all results documented, any incident should be investigated and its impact on the continuation of the crop in the production programme should be determined.

32. Conditions under which plants may be removed from production should be defined. Acceptance limits should be set for materials (e.g. host proteins) that may interfere with the purification process. It should be verified that the results are within approved limits.

33. Environmental conditions (temperature, rain), which may affect the quality attributes and. yield of the recombinant protein from time of planting, through cultivation to harvest and. interim storage of harvested materials should be documented. The principles in documents such as Guideline on Good Agricultural and Collection Practice for Starting Materials of. Herbal origin' should be taken into account when drawing up such criteria..

### B9. GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS

There are potentially 2 types of GT products (vectors and genetically modified cells) and both are within the scope of the guidance in this section. For cell based GT products, some aspects of guidance in section B10 may be applicable.

34. Since the cells used in the manufacture of gene therapy products are obtained either from humans (autologous or allogeneic) or animals (xenogeneic), there is a potential risk of. contamination by adventitious agents. Special considerations must be applied to the segregation of autologous materials obtained from infected donors. The robustness of the control and test measures for such starting materials, cryoprotectants, culture media, cells and vectors should be based on QRM principles and in line with the MA or CTA. Established cell lines used for viral vector production and their control and test measures should similarly be based on QRM principles. Virus seed lots and cell banking systems should be used where relevant.

35. Factors such as the nature of the genetic material, type of (viral or non-viral) vector and type of cells have a bearing on the range of potential impurities, adventitious agents and cross-contaminations that should be taken into account as part of the development of an overall strategy to minimise risk. This strategy should be used as a basis for the design of the process, the manufacturing and storage facilities and equipment, cleaning and decontamination procedures, packaging, labelling and distribution.

36. The manufacture and testing of gene therapy medicinal products raises specific issues regarding the safety and quality of the final product and safety issues for recipients and staff. A risk based approach for operator, environment and patient safety and the implementation of controls based on the biological hazard class should be applied. Legislated local and, if applicable, international safety measures should be applied..
37. Personnel (including QC and maintenance staff) and material flows, including those for storage and testing (e.g. starting materials, in-process and final product samples and. environmental monitoring samples), should be controlled on the basis of QRM principles, where possible utilising unidirectional flows. This should take into account movement between areas containing different genetically modified organisms and areas containing. non-genetically-modified organisms.
38. Any special cleaning and decontamination methods required for the range of organisms. being handled should be considered in the design of facilities and equipment. Where possible, the environmental monitoring programme should be supplemented by the. inclusion of methods to detect the presence of the specific organisms being cultivated.
39. Where replication limited vectors are used, measures should be in place to prevent the introduction of wild-type viruses, which may lead to the formation of replication competent recombinant vectors.
40. An emergency plan for dealing with accidental release of viable organisms should be in place. This should address methods and procedures for containment, protection of operators, cleaning, decontamination and safe return to use. An assessment of impact on the immediate products and any others in the affected area should also be made.
41. Facilities for the manufacture of viral vectors should be separated from other areas by specific measures. The arrangements for separation should be demonstrated to be effective. Closed systems should be used wherever possible, sample collection additions and transfers should prevent the release of viral material.
42. Concurrent manufacture of different viral gene therapy vectors in the same area is not acceptable. Concurrent production of non-viral vectors in the same area should be controlled on the basis of QRM principles. Changeover procedures between campaigns should be demonstrated to be effective.
43. A description of the production of vectors and genetically modified cells should be available in sufficient detail to ensure the traceability of the products from the starting material (plasmids, gene of interest and regulatory sequences, cell banks, and viral or non viral vector stock) to the finished product.
44. Shipment of products containing and/or consisting of GMO should conform to appropriate legislation.
45. The following considerations apply to the ex-vivo gene transfer to recipient cells: a) These should take place in facilities dedicated to such activities where appropriate containment arrangements exist. b) Measures (including considerations outlined under paragraph 10 in Part A) to different patients are required. This should include the use of validated cleaning procedures. The concurrent use of different viral vectors should be subject to controls based on QRM principles. Some viral vectors (e.g. Retro- or Lenti-viruses) cannot be used in the manufacturing process of genetically modified cells until they have been shown to be devoid of replication-competent contaminating vector.
c) Traceability requirements must be maintained. There should be a clear definition of a batch, from cell source to final product container(s).
d) For products that utilise non-biological means to deliver the gene, their physicochemical properties should be documented and tested.

### B10. SOMATIC AND XENOGENIC CELL THERAPY PRODUCTS AND TISSUE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS

For genetically modified cell based products that are not classified as GT products, some
aspects of guidance in section B9 may be applicable.
46. Use should be made, where they are available, of authorised sources (i.e. licensed medicinal products or medical devices which have gone through a conformity assessment procedure) of additional substances (such as cellular products, bio-molecules, bio-materials,. scaffolds, matrices).
47. Where devices, including custom-made devices, are incorporated as part of the products: a) There should be written agreement between the manufacturer of the medicinal product and the manufacturer of the medical device, which should provide enough information on the medical device to avoid alteration of its properties during manufacturing of the ATMP. This should include the requirement to control changes proposed for the medical device. b) The technical agreement should also require the exchange of information on deviations in the manufacture of the medical device.
48. Since somatic cells are obtained either from humans (autologous or allogeneic) or animals (xenogeneic), there is a potential risk of contamination by adventitious agents. Special considerations must be applied to the segregation of autologous materials obtained. from infected donors or related to cell pooling. The robustness of the control and test measures put in place for these source materials should be ensured. Animals from which tissues and cells are collected should be reared and processed according to the principles. defined in the relevant guidelines..
49. Careful attention should be paid to specific requirements at any cryopreservation stages, e.g. the rate of temperature change during freezing or thawing. The type of storage chamber, placement and retrieval process should minimise the risk of crosscontamination, maintain the quality of the products and facilitate their accurate retrieval. Documented procedures should be in place for the secure handling and storage of products with positive serological markers..
50. Sterility tests should be conducted on antibiotic-free cultures of cells or cell banks to provide evidence for absence of bacterial and fungal contamination and consider the detection of fastidious organism..
51. Where relevant, a stability-monitoring programme should be in place together with. reference and retain samples in sufficient quantity to permit further examination.

# MANUFACTURE OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS

## PRINCIPLE

The manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals should be undertaken in accordance with Annex 1 and Annex 3-2 of Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc. and Annex 15 of this guide. This annex specifically addresses some of the practices, which may be specific for radiopharmaceuticals.

Note i. This annex is also applicable to radiopharmaceuticals used in clinical trials.
Note ii. Transport of radiopharmaceuticals is regulated by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) and radiation protection requirements..
Note iii. It is recognised that there are acceptable methods, other than those described in this annex, which are capable of achieving the principles of Quality Assurance. Other methods should be validated and provide a level of Quality Assurance at least equivalent to those set out in this annex..

## INTRODUCTION

Q. The manufacturing and handling of radiopharmaceuticals is potentially hazardous. The level of risk depends in particular upon the types of radiation, the energy of radiation and the half-lives of radioactive isotopes. Particular attention must be paid to the prevention of crosscontamination, to the retention of radionuclide contaminants, and to waste disposal.

R. Due to short shelf-life of their radionuclides, some radiopharmaceuticals may be released. before completion of all quality control tests. In this case, the exact and detailed description of the whole release procedure including the responsibilities of the involved personnel and. the continuous assessment of the effectiveness of the quality assurance system is essential..

S. This guideline is applicable to manufacturing procedures employed by industrial manufacturers, Nuclear Centres/Institutes and PET Centres for the production and quality control of the following types of products:

12) Radiopharmaceuticals
13) Positron Emitting (PET) Radiopharmaceuticals
14) Radioactive Precursors for radiopharmaceutical production
15) Radionuclide Generators

\* Target and transfer system from cyclotron to synthesis rig may be considered as the first step of active substance manufacture.

T. The manufacturer of the final radiopharmaceutical should describe and justify the steps for manufacture of the active substance and the final medicinal product and which Annex 1 and Annex 3-2 of Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc. or Annex 15 of this guide applies for the specific process/manufacturing steps.

U. Preparation of radiopharmaceuticals involves adherence to regulations on radiation protection.

V. Radiopharmaceuticals to be administered parenterally should comply with sterility requirements for parenterals and, where relevant, aseptic working conditions for the manufacture of sterile medicinal products, which are covered in Annex 1 of this guide.

W. Specifications and quality control testing procedures for the most commonly used radiopharmaceuticals are specified in the official compendia or in the marketing authorisation.

Clinical Trials

X. Radiopharmaceuticals intended for use in clinical trials as investigational medicinal products should in addition be produced in accordance with the principles in Annex 1 and Annex 4-2 of the Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc. and Annex 11 of this guide.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

Y.Quality assurance is of even greater importance in the manufacture of. radiopharmaceuticals because of their particular characteristics, low volumes and in some circumstances the need to administer the product before testing is complete.

Z. As with all pharmaceuticals, the products must be well protected against contamination and cross-contamination. However, the environment and the operators must also be protected against radiation. This means that the role of an effective quality assurance system is of the utmost importance.

A. It is important that the data generated by the monitoring of premises and processes are rigorously recorded and evaluated as part of the release process.

B. The principles of qualification and validation should be applied to the manufacturing of radiopharmaceuticals and a risk management approach should be used to determine the extent of qualification/validation, focusing on a combination of Good Manufacturing Practice and Radiation Protection.

## PERSONNEL

C. All manufacturing operations should be carried out under the responsibility of personnel with additional competence in radiation protection. Personnel involved in production, analytical control and release of radiopharmaceuticals should be appropriately trained in radiopharmaceutical specific aspects of the quality management system. The Authorised Person should have the overall responsibility for release of the products.

D. 14.. All personnel (including those concerned with cleaning and maintenance) employed in areas where radioactive products are manufactured should receive additional training adapted to this class of products. .

E. Where production facilities are shared with research institutions, the research personnel must be adequately trained in GMP regulations and the QA function must review and approve the research activities to ensure that they do not pose any hazard to the manufacturing of radiopharmaceuticals.

## PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

### General

F. Radioactive products should be manufactured in controlled (environmental and radioactive) areas. All manufacturing steps should take place in self-contained facilities dedicated to radiopharmaceuticals

G. Measures should be established and implemented to prevent crosscontamination from personnel, materials, radionuclides etc. Closed or contained equipment should be used whenever appropriate. Where open equipment is used, or equipment is opened, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of contamination. The risk assessment should demonstrate that the environmental cleanliness level proposed is suitable for the type of product being manufactured.

H. Access to the manufacturing areas should be via a gowning area and should be restricted to authorised personnel.

I. Workstations and their environment should be monitored with respect to radioactivity, particulate and microbiological quality as established during performance qualification (PQ).

J. Preventive maintenance, calibration and qualification programmes should be operated to ensure that all facilities and equipment used in the manufacture of radiopharmaceutical are suitable and qualified. These activities should be carried out by competent personnel and records and logs should be maintained.

K. Precautions should be taken to avoid radioactive contamination within the facility.
Appropriate controls should be in place to detect any radioactive contamination, either.
directly through the use of radiation detectors or indirectly through a swabbing routine..

L. Equipment should be constructed so that surfaces that come into contact with the product are not reactive, additive or absorptive so as to alter the quality of the radiopharmaceutical.

M. Re-circulation of air extracted from area where radioactive products are handled should be avoided unless justified. Air outlets should be designed to minimize environmental contamination by radioactive particles and gases and appropriate measures should be taken to protect the controlled areas from particulate and microbial contamination.

N. In order to contain radioactive particles, it may be necessary for the air pressure to be lower where products are exposed, compared with the surrounding areas. However, it is still necessary to protect the product from environmental contamination. This may be achieved by, for example, using barrier technology or airlocks, acting as pressure sinks.

### Sterile production

O. Sterile radiopharmaceuticals may be divided into those, which are manufactured aseptically, and those, which are terminally sterilised. The facility should maintain the. appropriate level of environmental cleanliness for the type of operation being performed. For manufacture of sterile products the working zone where products or containers may be exposed to the environment, the cleanliness requirements should comply with the requirements described in Annex 1 of this guide..

P. For manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals a risk assessment may be applied to determine the appropriate pressure differences, air flow direction and air quality..

Q. In case of use of closed and automated systems (chemical synthesis, purification, on-line sterile filtration) a grade C environment (usually "Hot-cell') will be suitable. Hot-cells should meet a high degree of air cleanliness, with filtered feed air, when closed. Aseptic activities must be carried out in a grade A area.

R. Prior to the start of manufacturing, assembly of sterilised equipment and consumables (tubing, sterilised filters and sterile closed and sealed vials to a sealed fluid path) must be performed under aseptic conditions

## DOCUMENTATION

S. All documents related to the manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared, reviewed, approved and distributed according to written procedures..

T. Specifications should be established and documented for raw materials, labelling and packaging materials, critical intermediates and the finished radiopharmaceutical. Specifications should also be in place for any other critical items used in the manufacturing process, such as process aids, gaskets, sterile filtering kits, that could critically impact on quality.

U. Acceptance criteria should be established for the radiopharmaceutical including criteria for release and shelf life specifications (examples: chemical identity of the isotope, radioactive concentration, purity, and specific activity).

V. Records of major equipment use, cleaning, sanitisation or sterilisation and maintenance. should show the product name and batch number, where appropriate, in addition to the date and time and signature for the persons involved in these activities..

W. Records should be retained for one year after the expiry date of the products unless another timeframe is specified in national requirements..

## PRODUCTION

X. Production of different radioactive products in the same working area (i.e. hotcell, LAF unit), at the same time should be avoided in order to minimise the risk of cross-contamination

or mix-up.
Y. Special attention should be paid to validation including validation of computerised systems which should be carried out in accordance in compliance Annex 9 of this guide. New. manufacturing processes should be validated prospectively.
Z. The critical parameters should normally be identified before or during validation and the ranges necessary for reproducible operation should be defined.
A. Integrity testing of the membrane filter should be performed for aseptically filled products, taking into account the need for radiation protection and maintenance of filter sterility.

B. Due to radiation exposure it is accepted that most of the labelling of the direct container, is done prior to manufacturing. Sterile empty closed vials may be labelled with partial information prior to filling providing that this procedure does not compromise sterility or prevent visual control of the filled vial.

## QUALITY CONTROL

C. Some radiopharmaceuticals may have to be distributed and used on the basis of an assessment of batch documentation and before all chemical and microbiology tests have been. completed.

Radiopharmaceutical product release may be carried out in two or more stages, before and

after full analytical testing: a) Assessment by a designated person of batch processing records, which should cover production conditions and analytical testing performed thus far, before allowing transportation of the radiopharmaceutical under quarantine status to the clinical department. b) Assessment of the final analytical data, ensuring all deviations from normal. procedures are documented, justified and appropriately released prior to documented certification by the Authorised Person. Where certain test results are not available before use of the product, the Authorised Person should conditionally certify the product before it is used and should finally certify the product after all the test results are obtained.
D. Most radiopharmaceuticals are intended for use within a short time and the period of
validity with regard to the radioactive shelf-life, must be clearly stated.
E. Radiopharmaceuticals having radionuclides with long half-lives should be tested to show,
that they meet all relevant acceptance criteria before release and certification by the
Authorised Person.
F. Before testing is performed samples can be stored to allow sufficient radioactivity decay.
All tests including the sterility test should be performed as soon as possible.
G. A written procedure detailing the assessment of production and analytical data, which
should be considered before the batch is dispatched, should be established.
H. Products that fail to meet acceptance criteria should be rejected. If the material is.
reprocessed, pre-established procedures should be followed and the finished product should
meet acceptance criteria before release. Returned products may not be reprocessed and must
be stored as radioactive waste.
I. A procedure should also describe the measures to be taken by Authorised Person if
unsatisfactory test results (Out-of-Specification) are obtained after dispatch and before
expiry. Such events should be investigated to include the relevant corrective and preventative
actions taken to prevent future events.
This process must be documented.
J. Information should be given to the clinical responsible persons, if necessary. To facilitate.
this, a traceability system should be implemented for radiopharmaceuticals.
K. A system to verify the quality of starting materials should be in place. Supplier approval
should include an evaluation that provides adequate assurance that the material consistently.
meets specifications. The starting materials, packaging materials and critical process aids
should be purchased from approved suppliers.

## REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES

L. For radiopharmaceuticals sufficient samples of each batch of bulk formulated product should be retained for at least six months after expiry of the finished medicinal product unless otherwise justified through risk management..

M. Samples of starting materials, other than solvents gases or water used in the manufacturing process should be retained for at least two years after the release of the product. That period may be shortened if the period of stability of the material as indicated in the relevant specification is shorter..

N. Other conditions may be defined by agreement with the competent authority, for the sampling and retaining of starting materials and products manufactured individually or in small quantities or when their storage could raise special problems.

## DISTRIBUTION

O. Distribution of the finished product under controlled conditions, before all appropriate test results are available, is acceptable for radiopharmaceuticals, providing the product is not administered by the receiving institute until satisfactory test results has been received and assessed by a designated person.

## GLOSSARY

**Manufacturing:** production, quality control and release and delivery of radiopharmaceuticals from the active substance and starting materials.

**Hot-cells:** shielded workstations for manufacture and handling of radioactive materials. Hotcells are not necessarily designed as an isolator.

**Authorised person:** Person recognised by the authority as having the necessary basic scientific and technical background and experience..

# MANUFACTURE OF MEDICINAL GASES

## PRINCIPLE

This Annex deals with the manufacture of active substance gases and the manufacture of medicinal gases.

The delineation between the manufacture of the active substance and the manufacture of the medicinal product should be clearly defined in each Marketing Authorisation dossier. Normally, the production and purification steps of the gas belong to the field of manufacture of active substances. Gases enter the pharmaceutical field from the first storage of gas intended for such use.

Manufacture of active substance gases should comply with Annex 3-3 of Regulations of Safety. of Medicinal Products, etc., with the relevant part of this Annex, with Annex 15 of this guide and with the other Annexes of the Guide if relevant..

Manufacture of medicinal gases should comply with Annex 1 and Annex 3-3 of Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc., with the relevant part of this Annex and with the other Annexes of the Guide if relevant..

In the exceptional cases of continuous processes where no intermediate storage of gas between the manufacture of the active substance and the manufacture of the medicinal product is possible, the whole process (from starting materials of active substance to medicinal finished product) should be considered as belonging to the pharmaceutical field. This should be clearly stated in. the Marketing Authorisation dossier..

The Annex does not cover the manufacture and handling of medicinal gases in hospitals unless this is considered industrial preparation or manufacturing. However, relevant parts of this Annex may be used as a basis for such activities.

**Manufacture of active substance gases**

Active substance gases can be prepared by chemical synthesis or be obtained from natural sources followed by purification steps, if necessary.

P. The processes corresponding to these two methods of manufacturing active substance gases should comply with Annex 3-3 of Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc.. and Annex 15 of this guide. However:.

a) the requirements regarding starting materials for active substances (Annex 15, Chapter
7 of this guide) do not apply to the production of active substance gases by air separation (however, the manufacturer should ensure that the quality of ambient air is suitable for the established process and any changes in the quality of ambient air do not affect the quality of the active substance gas);. b) the requirements regarding on-going stability studies (Annex 15, Chapter 11.5 of this guide), which are used to confirm storage conditions and expiry/retest dates (Annex
15, Chapter 11.6 of this guide), do not apply in case initial stability studies have been replaced by bibliographic data; and c) the requirements regarding reserve/retention samples (Annex 15, Chapter 11.7 of this guide) do not apply to active substance gases, unless otherwise specified..

) The nroduction of active cnhctance aacec thronah a continnouc nrocece chonld he continuously monitored for quality. The results of this monitoring should be kept in a manner permitting trend evaluation.

R. In addition:

a) transfers and deliveries of active substance gases in bulk should comply with the same requirements as those mentioned below for the medicinal gases (sections 19 to 21 of. this Annex);
b) filling of active substance gases into cylinders or into mobile cryogenic vessels should. comply with the same requirements as those mentioned below for the medicinal gases (sections 22 to 37 of this Annex) as well as Annex 15 Chapter 9 of this guide..

**Manufacture of medicinal gases**

Manufacture of medicinal gases is generally carried out in closed equipment. Consequently, environmental contamination of the product is minimal. However, risks of contamination (or cross contamination with other gases) may arise, in particular because of the reuse of containers. S. Requirements applying to cylinders should also apply to cylinders bundles (except storage and transportation under cover).

## PERSONNEL

T. All personnel involved in the manufacture and distribution of medicinal gases should receive an appropriate GMP training applying to this type of products. They should be aware of the critically important aspects and potential hazards for patients from these products.

U. Personnel of subcontractors that could influence the quality of medicinal gases (such as personnel in charge of maintenance of cylinders or valves) should be appropriately trained.

## PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

### Premises

V. Cylinders and mobile cryogenic vessels should be checked, prepared, filled and stored in a separate area from non-medicinal gases, and there should be no exchange of cylinders/mobile cryogenic vessels between these areas. However, it could be accepted to check, prepare, fill and store other gases in the same areas, provided they comply with the specifications of medicinal gases and that the manufacturing operations are performed according to GMP standards.

W.Premises should provide sufficient space for manufacturing, testing and storage operations to avoid the risk of mix-up. Premises should be designated to provide: a) separate marked areas for different gases; b) clear identification and segregation of cylinders/mobile cryogenic vessels at various stages of processing (e.g. "waiting checking", "awaiting filling", ''quarantine",. "certified", "rejected "/prepared deliveries"). The method used to achieve these various levels of segregation will depend on the nature, extent and complexity of the overall operation. Marked-out floor areas, partitions, barriers, signs, labels or other appropriate means could be used.

X. Empty cylinders/home cryogenic vessels after sorting or maintenance, and filled cylinders/home cryogenic vessels should be stored under cover, protected from adverse weather conditions. Filled cylinders/mobile cryogenic vessels should be stored in a manner that ensures that they will be delivered in a clean state, compatible with the environment in which they will be used..

Y.Specific storage conditions should be provided as required by the Marketing Authorisation (e.g. for gas mixtures where phase separation occurs on freezing).

### Equipment

Z. Equipment should be designed to ensure the correct gas is filled into the correct container. There should normally be no cross connections between pipelines carrying different gases. If cross connections are needed (e.g. filling equipment of mixtures), qualification should. ensure that there is no risk of cross contamination between the different gases. In addition, the manifolds should be equipped with specific connections. These connections may be. subject to international or national standards. The use of connections meeting different standards at the same filling site should be carefully controlled, as well as the use of adaptors needed in some situations to bypass the specific fill connection systems..

A. Tanks and tankers should be dedicated to a single and defined quality of gas. However, medicinal gases may be stored or transported in the same tanks, other containers used for intermediate storage, or tankers, as the same nonmedicinal gas, provided that the quality of the latter is at least equal to the quality of the medicinal gas and that GMP standards are. maintained. In such cases, quality risk management should be performed and documented.

B. A common system supplying gas to medicinal and non-medicinal gas manifolds is only acceptable if there is a validated method to prevent backflow from the non-medicinal gas line to the medicinal gas line.

C. Filling manifolds should be dedicated to a single medicinal gas or to a given mixture of medicinal gases. In exceptional cases, filling gases used for other medical purposes on manifolds dedicated to medicinal gases may be acceptable if justified and performed under control. In these cases, the quality of the non-medicinal gas should be at least equal to the required quality of the medicinal gas and GMP standards should be maintained. Filling should then be carried out by campaigns.

D. Repair and maintenance operations (including cleaning and purging) of equipment, should not adversely affect the quality of the medicinal gases. In particular, procedures should describe the measures to be taken after repair and maintenance operations involving breaches of the system's integrity. Specifically it should be demonstrated that the equipment is free from any contamination that may adversely affect the quality of the finished product before releasing it for use. Records should be maintained.

E. A procedure should describe the measures to be taken when a tanker is back into medicinal gas service (after transporting non-medicinal gas in the conditions mentioned in section 12, or after a maintenance operation). This should include analytical testing.

## PRODUCTION

### **Transfers and deliveries of cryogenic and liquefied gas**

H. The transfers of cryogenic or liquefied gases from primary storage, including controls. before transfers, should be in accordance with validated procedures designed to avoid any. contamination. Transfer lines should be equipped with non-return valves or other suitable. alternatives. Flexible connections, and coupling hoses and connectors should be flushed with the relevant gas before use. 1. The transfer hoses used to fill tanks and tankers should be equipped with product-specific connections. The use of adaptors allowing the connection of tanks and tankers not dedicated to the same gases should be adequately controlled.

J. Deliveries of gas may be added to tanks containing the same quality of gas provided that a. sample is tested to ensure that the quality of the delivered gas is acceptable. This sample may be taken from the gas to be delivered or from the receiving tank after delivery..

Note: See specific arrangements in section 42 for filling of tanks retained by customers at the customer's premises.

### **Filling and labelling of cylinders and mobile cryogenic vessels**

K. Before filling cylinders and mobile cryogenic vessels, a batch (batches) of gas(es) should be determined, controlled according to specifications and approved for filling.

L. In the case of continuous processes as those mentioned in Principle', there should be adequate in-process controls to ensure that the gas complies with specifications.

M. Cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels and valves should conform to appropriate technical specifications and any relevant requirements of the Marketing Authorisation. They should be dedicated to a single medicinal gas or to a given mixture of medicinal gases. Cylinders should be colour-coded according to relevant standards. They should preferably be fitted with minimum pressure retention valves with non-return mechanism in order to get adequate protection against contamination.

N. Cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels and valves should be checked before first use in production, and should be properly maintained. Where medical devices have gone through a conformity assessment procedure, the maintenance should address the medical device manufacturer's instructions.

O. Checks and maintenance operations should not affect the quality and the safety of the medicinal product. The water used for the hydrostatic pressure testing carried out on cylinders should be at least of drinking quality.

P. As part of the checks and maintenance operations, cylinders should be subject to an. internal visual inspection before fitting the valve, to make sure they are not contaminated with water or other contaminants. This should be done:.

16) when they are new and initially put into medicinal gas service;

17) following any hydrostatic statutory pressure test or equivalent test where the valve is removed;
18) whenever the valve is replaced.

After fitting, the valve should be kept closed to prevent any contamination from entering the cylinder. If there is any doubt about the internal condition of the cylinder, the valve should be removed and the cylinder internally inspected to ensure it has not been contaminated.

Q. Maintenance and repair operations of cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels and valves are the responsibility of the manufacturer of the medicinal product. If subcontracted, they should only be carried out by approved subcontractors, and contracts including technical agreements should be established. Subcontractors should be audited to ensure that appropriate standards are maintained.

R. There should be a system in place to ensure traceability of cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels and valves.

S. Checks to be performed before filling should include:.

a) in the case of cylinders, a check, carried out according to defined procedure, to ensure there is a positive residual pressure in each cylinder;. 19) if the cylinder is fitted with a minimum pressure retention valve, when there is no signal indicating there is a positive residual pressure, the correct functioning of the valve should be checked, and if the valve is shown not to function properly the cylinder. should be sent to maintenance, 20) if the cylinder is not fitted with a minimum pressure retention valve, when there is no positive residual pressure the cylinder should be put aside for additional measures, to make sure it is not contaminated with water or other contaminants; additional measures could consist of internal visual inspection followed by cleaning using a validated method;. b) a check to ensure that all previous batch labels have been removed; c) a check that any damaged product labels have been removed and replaced;. d) a visual external inspection of each cylinder, mobile cryogenic vessel and valve for dents, arc burns, debris, other damage and contamination with oil or grease; cleaning should be done if necessary;. e) a check of each cylinder or mobile cryogenic vessel outlet connection to determine that it is the proper type for the particular gas involved; f) a check of the date of the next test to be performed on the valve (in the case of valves that need to be periodically tested); g) a check of the cylinders or mobile cryogenic vessels to ensure that any tests required by national or international regulations (e.g. hydrostatic pressure test or equivalent for cylinders) have been conducted and still is valid; and h) a check to determine that each container is colour-coded as specified in the Marketing Authorisation (colour-coding of the relevant national / international standards).
T. A batch should be defined for filling operations.
U. Cylinders which have been returned for refilling should be prepared with care in order to.
minimise risks for contamination in line with the procedures defined in the Marketing.
Authorisation. These procedures, which should include evacuation and/or purging
operations, should be validated.
V. Mobile cryogenic vessels that have been returned for refilling should be prepared with
care in order to minimise the risks of contamination, in line with the procedures defined in.
the Marketing Authorisation. In particular, mobile vessels with no residual pressure should
be prepared using a validated method.
W. There should be appropriate checks to ensure that each cylinder/mobile cryogenic vessel
has been properly filled..
X. Each filled cylinder should be tested for leaks using an appropriate method, prior to fitting.
the tamperevident seal or device (see section 36). The test method should not introduce any.
contaminant into the valve outlet and, if applicable, should be performed after any quality
sample is taken.
Y. After filling, cylinders valves should be fitted with covers to protect the outlets from.
contamination. Cylinders and mobile cryogenic vessels should be fitted with tamper-evident
seals or devices..
Z. Each cylinder or mobile cryogenic vessel should be labelled. The batch number and the

expiry date may be on a separate label.

A. In the case of medicinal gases produced by mixing two or more different gases (in-line before filling or directly into the cylinders); the mixing process should be validated to ensure that the gases are properly mixed in every cylinder and that the mixture is homogeneous..

## QUALITY CONTROL

B. Each batch of medicinal gas (cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels, hospital tanks) should be tested in accordance with the requirements of the Marketing Authorisation and certified. C. Unless different provisions are required in the Marketing Authorisation, the sampling plan and the analysis to be performed should comply, in the case of cylinders with the following requirements.

a) In the case of a single medicinal gas filled via a multi-cylinder manifold, the gas from at least one cylinder from each manifold filling cycle should be tested for identity and assay each time the cylinders are changed on the manifold.
b) In the case of a single medicinal gas filled put into cylinders one at a time, the gas.. from at least one cylinder of each uninterrupted filling cycle should be tested for identity and assay. An example of an uninterrupted filling cycle is one shift's production using the same personnel, equipment, and batch of gas to be filled.
c) In the case of a medicinal gas produced by mixing two or more gases in a cylinder. from the same manifold, the gas from every cylinder should be tested for assay and identity of each component gas. For excipients, if any, testing on identity could be. performed on one cylinder per manifold filling cycle (or per uninterrupted filling cycle in case of cylinders filled one at a time). Fewer cylinders may be tested in case of validated automated filling system.
d) Premixed gases should follow the same principles as single gases when continuous inline testing of the mixture to be filled is performed. Premixed gases should follow the same principle as medicinal gases produced by mixing gases in the cylinders when there is no continuous inline testing of the mixture. to be filled.
Testing for water content should be performed unless otherwise justified..
Other sampling and testing procedures that provide at least equivalent level of quality
assurance mav be iustified D. Unless different provisions are required in the Marketing Authorisation, final testing on mobile cryogenic vessels should include a test for assay and identity on each vessel. Testing by batches should only be carried out if it has been demonstrated that the critical attributes of the gas remaining in each vessel before refilling have been maintained..
E. Cryogenic vessels retained by customers (hospital tanks or home cryogenic vessels), which are refilled in place from dedicated tankers do not need to be sampled after filling,. provided that a certificate of analysis on the contents of the tanker accompanies the delivery. However, it should be demonstrated that the specification of the gas in the vessels is maintained over the successive refillings.
F. Reference and retention samples are not required, unless otherwise specified.
G. On-going stability studies are not required in case initial stability studies have been replaced by bibliographic data.

## TRANSPORTATION OF PACKAGED GASES

H. Filled gas cylinders and home cryogenic vessels should be protected during transportation so that, in particular, they are delivered to customers in a clean state compatible with the environment in which they will be used.

# MANUFACTURE OF HERBAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS

## PRINCIPLE

Because of their often complex and variable nature, control of starting materials, storage and processing assume particular importance in the manufacture of herbal medicinal products.. The "starting material' in the manufacture of an herbal medicinal product can be a medicinal. plant, an herbal substance or an herbal preparation1. The herbal substance should be of. suitable quality and supporting data should be provided to the manufacturer of the herbal. preparation/herbal medicinal product. Ensuring consistent quality of the herbal substance may require more detailed information on its agricultural production. The selection of seeds, cultivation and harvesting conditions represent important aspects of the quality of the herbal. substance and can influence the consistency of the finished product. Recommendations on. an appropriate quality assurance system for good agricultural and collection practice are provided in national or international guidance documents on Good Agricultural and Collection Practice for starting materials of herbal origin..

This Annex applies to all herbal starting materials: medicinal plants, herbal substances or herbal preparations.

## Explanatory Notes

..The GMP classification of the herbal material is dependent upon the use made of it by the. manufacturing authorisation holder. The material may be classified as an active substance, an intermediate or a finished product. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer of the. medicinal product to ensure that the appropriate GMP classification is applied..

\* Manufacturers should ensure that these steps are carried out in accordance with the marketing authorisation / registration. For those initial steps that take place in the field, as justified in the marketing authorisation / registration, the national or international standards of Good Agricultural and Collection Practice for starting materials of herbal origin (GACP)# are applicable. GMP is applicable to further cutting and drying steps.

\*\* Regarding the expression from plants and distillation, if it is necessary for these activities. to be an integral part of harvesting to maintain the quality of the product within the approved specifications, it is acceptable that they are performed in the field, provided that. the cultivation is in compliance with national or international standards of GACP#. These circumstances should be regarded as exceptional and justified in the relevant marketing authorisation / registration documentation. For activities carried out in the field, appropriate documentation, control, and validation according to the GMP principles. should be assured. Regulatory authorities may carry out GMP inspections of these. activities in order to assess compliance.

## PREMISES

### Storage areas

I. Herbal substances should be stored in separate areas. The storage area should be equipped in such a way as to give protection against the entry of insects or other animals, especially. rodents. Effective measures should be taken to prevent the spread of any such animals and micro-organisms brought in with the crude substance, to prevent fermentation or mould growth and to prevent cross-contamination. Different enclosed areas should be used to. quarantine incoming herbal substances and for the approved herbal substances..

J. The storage area should be well aerated and the containers should be located in such a way as to allow free circulation of air.

K. Special attention should be paid to the cleanliness and good maintenance of the storage areas particularly when dust is generated..

L. Storage of herbal substances and herbal preparations may require special conditions of humidity, temperature or light protection; these conditions should be provided and monitored.

### Production area

M. Specific provisions should be made during sampling, weighing, mixing and processing operations of herbal substances and herbal preparations whenever dust is generated, to facilitate cleaning and to avoid cross-contamination, as for example, dust extraction, dedicated premises, etc.

### Equipment

N. The equipment, filtering materials etc. used in the manufacturing process must be compatible with the extraction solvent, in order to prevent any release or undesirable absorption of substance that could affect the product..

## DOCUMENTATION

### Specifications for starting materials

O. Herbal medicinal product manufacturers must ensure that they use only herbal starting. materials manufactured in accordance with GMP and the Marketing Authorisation dossier. Comprehensive documentation on audits of the herbal starting material suppliers carried out by, or on behalf of the herbal medicinal product manufacturer should be made available. Audit trails for the active substance are fundamental to the quality of the starting material. The manufacturer should verify, where appropriate, whether the suppliers of the herbal substance / preparation are in compliance with Good Agricultural and Collection Practice and - if not - apply appropriate controls in line with Quality Risk Management (QRM)..

P. To fulfil the specification requirements described in the basic requirements of the Guide (Chapter 4), documentation for herbal substances / preparations should include:

1) the binomial scientific name of plant (genus, species, subspecies / variety and author (e.g. Linnaeus); other relevant information such as the cultivar name and the chemotype

should also be provided, as appropriate;

2) details of the source of the plant (country or region of origin and where applicable, cultivation, time of harvesting, collection procedures, possible pesticides used, possible radioactive contamination, etc.);

3) which part(s) of the plant is/are used;

5) a description of the herbal substance and its macro and microscopic examination; 6) suitable identification tests including, where appropriate, identification tests for constituents with known therapeutic activity, or markers. Specific distinctive tests are required where an herbal substance is liable to be adulterated / substituted. A reference authentic specimen should be available for identification purposes;
7) the water content for herbal substances, determined in accordance with the relevant Pharmacopoeia;
8) assay of constituents of known therapeutic activity or, where appropriate, of markers; the methods suitable to determine possible pesticide contamination and limits accepted in accordance with relevant Pharmacopoeia methods or, in absence of thereof, with an appropriate validated method, unless otherwise justified;
9) tests to determine fungal and/or microbial contamination, including aflatoxins, other mycotoxins, pest-infestations and limits accepted, as appropriate;
10) tests for toxic metals and for likely contaminants and adulterants, as appropriate; 11) tests for foreign materials, as appropriate;
12) any other additional test according to the relevant Pharmacopoeia general monograph on herbal substances or to the specific monograph of the herbal substance, as appropriate. Any treatment used to reduce fungal/microbial contamination or other infestation should be documented. Specifications and procedures should be available and should include details of process, tests and limits for residues.

### Processing instructions

Q. The processing instructions should describe the different operations carried out upon the herbal substance such as cleaning, drying, crushing and sifting, and include drying time and

temperatures, and methods used to control cut size or particle size.
R. In particular, there should be written instructions and records, which ensure that each container of herbal substance is carefully examined to detect any adulteration/substitution or presence of foreign matter, such as metal or glass pieces, animal parts or excrement, stones,. sand, etc., or rot and signs of decay..
S. The processing instructions should also describe security sieving or other methods of removing foreign materials and appropriate procedures for cleaning/selection of plant material before the storage of the approved herbal substance or before the start of. manufacturing.

T. For the production of an herbal preparation, instructions should include details of solvent, time and temperatures of extraction, details of any concentration stages and methods used.

## QUALITY CONTROL

### Sampling

U. Due to the fact that medicinal plant/herbal substances are heterogeneous in nature, their sampling should be carried out with special care by personnel with particular expertise. Each batch should be identified by its own documentation.

V. A reference sample of the plant material is necessary, especially in those cases where the herbal substance is not described in the relevant Pharmacopoeia. Samples of unmilled plant material are required if powders are used.
W. Quality Control personnel should have particular expertise and experience in herbal substances, herbal preparations and/or herbal medicinal products in order to be able to carry out identification tests and recognise adulteration, the presence of fungal growth, infestations, non-uniformity within a delivery of crude material, etc..
X. The identity and quality of herbal substances, herbal preparations and herbal medicinal products should be determined in accordance with the relevant current national or. international guidance on quality and specifications of herbal medicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products and, where relevant, to specific pharmacopoeial. monographs.

# SAMPLING OF STARTING AND PACKAGING MATERIALS

## PRINCIPLE

Sampling is an important operation in which only a small fraction of a batch is taken. Valid conclusions on the whole cannot be based on tests which have been carried out on nonrepresentative samples. Correct sampling is thus an essential part of a system of Quality Assurance.

## PERSONNEL

Y. Personnel who take samples should receive initial and on-going regular training in the disciplines relevant to correct sampling. This training should include:

13) sampling plans,
14) written sampling procedures,
15) the techniques and equipment for sampling,
16) the risks of cross-contamination,
17) the precautions to be taken with regard to unstable and/or sterile substances,
18) the importance of considering the visual appearance of materials, containers and
labels,

19) the importance of recording any unexpected or unusual circumstances.

## STARTING MATERIALS

Z. The identity of a complete batch of starting materials can normally only be ensured if individual samples are taken from all the containers and an identity test performed on each sample. It is permissible to sample only a proportion of the containers where a validated procedure has been established to ensure that no single container of starting material will be incorrectly identified on its label.

1. This validation should take account of at least the following aspects: 20) nature and status of the manufacturer and of the supplier and their understanding of the GMP requirements of the Pharmaceutical Industry; 21) the Quality Assurance system of the manufacturer of the starting material; 22) the manufacturing conditions under which the starting material is produced and. controlled; 23) the nature of the starting material and the medicinal products in which it will be used. Under such arrangements, it is possible that a validated procedure exempting identity testing of each incoming container of starting material could be accepted for: 24) starting materials coming from a single product manufacturer or plant; 25) starting materials coming directly from a manufacturer or in the manufacturer's. sealed container where there is a history of reliability and regular audits of the manufacturer's Quality Assurance system are conducted by the purchaser (the manufacturer of the medicinal products or by an officially accredited body. It is improbable that a procedure could be satisfactorily validated for:. 26) starting materials supplied by intermediaries such as brokers where the source of

manufacture is unknown or not audited;
27) starting materials for use in parenteral products.

B. The quality of a batch of starting materials may be assessed by taking and testing a representative sample. The samples taken for identity testing could be used for this purpose. The number of samples taken for the preparation of a representative sample should be determined statistically and specified in a sampling plan. The number of individual samples which may be blended to form a composite sample should also be defined, taking into account the nature of the material, knowledge of the supplier and the homogeneity of the composite sample.

## PACKAGING MATERIAL

C. The sampling plan for packaging materials should take account of at least the following:.
the quantity received, the quality required, the nature of the material (e.g. primary packaging.
materials and/or printed packaging materials), the production methods, and the knowledge of Quality Assurance system of the packaging materials manufacturer based on audits. The.
number of samples taken should be determined statistically and specified in a sampling plan.

# MANUFACTURE OF LIQUIDS, CREAMS AND OINTMENTS

## PRINCIPLE

Liquids, creams and ointments may be particularly susceptible to microbial and other contamination during manufacture. Therefore special measures must be taken to prevent any contamination.

## PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

D. The use of closed systems of processing and transfer is recommended in order to protect the product from contamination. Production areas where the products or open clean containers are exposed should normally be effectively ventilated with filtered air..

E. Tanks, containers, pipework and pumps should be designed and installed so that they may. be readily cleaned and if necessary sanitised. In particular, equipment design should include. a minimum of dead-legs or sites where residues can accumulate and promote microbial proliferation.

F. The use of glass apparatus should be avoided wherever possible. High quality stainless steel is often the material of choice for product contact parts.

## PRODUCTION

G. The chemical and microbiological quality of water used in production should be specified. and monitored. Care should be taken in the maintenance of water systems in order to avoid the risk of microbial proliferation. After any chemical sanitization of the water systems, a validated flushing procedure should be followed to ensure that the sanitising agent has been. effectively removed.

H. The quality of materials received in bulk tankers should be checked before they are transferred to bulk storage tanks.
I. Care should be taken when transferring materials via pipelines to ensure that they are delivered to their correct destination.
J. Materials likely to shed fibres or other contaminants, like cardboard or wooden pallets, should not enter the areas where products or clean containers are exposed..
K. Care should be taken to maintain the homogeneity of mixtures, suspensions, etc. during filling. Mixing and filling processes should be validated. Special care should be taken at the beginning of a filling process, after stoppages and at the end of the process to ensure that homogeneity is maintained.

L. When the finished product is not immediately packaged, the maximum period of storage and the storage conditions should be specified and respected.

# MANUFACTURE OF PRESSURISED METERED DOSE AEROSOL PREPARATIONS FOR INHALATION

## PRINCIPLE

Manufacture of pressurised aerosol products for inhalation with metering valves requires.
some special provisions arising from the particular nature of this pharmaceutical form. It.
should occur under conditions which minimise microbial and particulate contamination.
Assurance of the quality of the valve components and, in the case of suspensions, of.
uniformity is also of particular importance.

## GENERAL

M. There are presently two common manufacturing and filling methods as follows:

a) Two-shot system (pressure filling). The active ingredient is suspended in a high boiling point propellant, the dose is filled into the container, the valve is crimped on and the lower boiling point propellant is injected through the valve stem to make up the finished product. The suspension of active ingredient in propellant is kept cool to reduce evaporation loss.

b) One-shot process (cold filling). The active ingredient is suspended in a mixture of propellants and held either under high pressure and/or at a low temperature. The suspension is then filled directly into the container in one shot.

## PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

N. Manufacture and filling should be carried out as far as possible in a closed system.

O. Where products or clean components are exposed, the area should be fed with filtered air, should comply with the requirements of at least a Grade D environment and should be entered through airlocks.

## PRODUCTION AND QUALITY CONTROL

P.Metering valves for aerosols are a more complex engineering article than most pharmaceutical components. Specifications, sampling and testing should be appropriate for this situation. Auditing the Quality Assurance system of the valve manufacturer is of particular importance.

Q. All fluids (e.g. liquid or gaseous propellants) should be filtered to remove particles greater than 0.2 micron. An additional filtration where possible immediately before filling is desirable.

R. Containers and valves should be cleaned using a validated procedure appropriate to the use of the product to ensure the absence of any contaminants such as fabrication aids (e.g. lubricants) or undue microbiological contaminants. After cleaning, valves should be kept in clean, closed containers and precautions taken not to introduce contamination during subsequent handling, e.g. taking samples. Containers should be provided to the filling line in a clean condition or cleaned on line immediately before filling.

S. Precautions should be taken to ensure uniformity of suspensions at the point of fill

throughout the filling process.

T. When a two-shot filling process is used, it is necessary to ensure that both shots are of the correct weight in order to achieve the correct composition. For this purpose, $100\%$ weight checking at each stage is often desirable.

U. Controls after filling should ensure the absence of undue leakage. Any leakage test should be performed in a way which avoids microbial contamination or residual moisture..

# COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS

## PRINCIPLE

This annex applies to all forms of computerised systems used as part of a GMP regulated activities. A computerised system is a set of software and hardware components which together fulfil certain functionalities.

The application should be validated; IT infrastructure should be qualified.

Where a computerised system replaces a manual operation, there should be no resultant decrease in product quality, process control or quality assurance. There should be no increase in the overall risk of the process.

## GENERAL

V. Risk Management

Risk management should be applied throughout the lifecycle of the computerised system taking into account patient safety, data integrity and product quality. As part of a risk. management system, decisions on the extent of validation and data integrity controls should. be based on a justified and documented risk assessment of the computerised system..

W. Personnel

There should be close cooperation between all relevant personnel such as Process Owner, System Owner, Authorised Persons and IT. All personnel should have appropriate qualifications, level of access and defined responsibilities to carry out their assigned duties.

3.1 When third parties (e.g. suppliers, service providers) are used e.g. to provide, install, configure, integrate, validate, maintain (e.g. via remote access), modify or retain a computerised system or related service or for data processing, formal agreements must exist between the manufacturer and any third parties, and these agreements should include clear statements of the responsibilities of the third party. IT-departments should be considered analogous.
3.1 The competence and reliability of a supplier are key factors when selecting a product or service provider. The need for an audit should be based on a risk assessment.
3.2 Documentation supplied with commercial off-the-shelf products should be reviewed by regulated users to check that user requirements are fulfilled.
3.3 Quality system and audit information relating to suppliers or developers of software and implemented systems should be made available to inspectors on request.

## PROJECT PHASE

Y. Validation

4.1 The validation documentation and reports should cover the relevant steps of the life cycle. Manufacturers should be able to justify their standards, protocols, acceptance criteria, procedures and records based on their risk assessment.
4.2 Validation documentation should include change control records (if applicable) and reports on any deviations observed during the validation process..
4.3 An up to date listing of all relevant systems and their GMP functionality (inventory). should be available. For critical systems an up-to-date system description detailing the physical and logical arrangements, data flows and interfaces with other systems or processes, any hardware. and software pre-requisites, and security measures should be available..
4.4 User Requirements Specifications should describe the required functions of the computerised system and be based on documented risk assessment and GMP impact. User requirements should be traceable throughout the life-cycle.
4.5 The regulated user should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the system has been developed in accordance with an appropriate quality management system. The supplier should be assessed appropriately.
4.6 For the validation of bespoke or customised computerised systems there should be a process in place that ensures the formal assessment and reporting of quality and. performance measures for all the life-cycle stages of the system.
4.7 Evidence of appropriate test methods and test scenarios should be demonstrated. Particularly, system (process) parameter limits, data limits and error handling should be considered. Automated testing tools and test environments should have documented assessments for their adequacy.
4.8 If data are transferred to another data format or system, validation should include checks that data are not altered in value and/or meaning during this migration process.

## OPERATIONAL PHASE

Z. Data

Computerised systems exchanging data electronically with other systems should include appropriate built-in checks for the correct and secure entry and processing of data, in order to minimize the risks.

A. Accuracy Checks

For critical data entered manually, there should be an additional check on the accuracy of the data. This check may be done by a second operator or by validated electronic means. The criticality and the potential consequences of erroneous or incorrectly entered data to a system should be covered by risk management.

B. Data Storage

7.1 Data should be secured by both physical and electronic means against damage. Stored data should be checked for accessibility, readability and accuracy. Access to data. should be ensured throughout the retention period.

7.2 Regular back-ups of all relevant data should be done. Integrity and accuracy of backup data and the ability to restore the data should be checked during validation and

monitored periodically.

C. Printouts

8.1 It should be possible to obtain clear printed copies of electronically stored data.

8.2 For records supporting batch release it should be possible to generate printouts indicating if any of the data has been changed since the original entry..

D. Audit Trails
Consideration should be given, based on a risk assessment, to building into the system the. creation of a record of all GMP-relevant changes and deletions (a system generated "audit trail"). For change or deletion of GMP-relevant data the reason should be documented. Audit trails need to be available and convertible to a generally intelligible form and regularly reviewed.

E. Change and Configuration Management

Any changes to a computerised system including system configurations should only be made in a controlled manner in accordance with a defined procedure..

F. Periodic Evaluation

Computerised systems should be periodically evaluated to confirm that they remain in a valid state and are compliant with GMP. Such evaluations should include, where appropriate, the. current range of functionality, deviation records, incidents, problems, upgrade history,. performance, reliability, security and validation status reports.

G. Security

12.1 Physical and/or logical controls should be in place to restrict access to computerised system to authorised persons. Suitable methods of preventing unauthorised entry to the system may include the use of keys, pass cards, personal codes with passwords, biometrics, restricted access to computer equipment and data storage areas..
12.2 The extent of security controls depends on the criticality of the computerised system.
12.3 Creation, change, and cancellation of access authorisations should be recorded.
12.4 Management systems for data and for documents should be designed to record the identity of operators entering, changing, confirming or deleting data including date and time.

H. Incident Management

All incidents, not only system failures and data errors, should be reported and assessed. The root cause of a critical incident should be identified and should form the basis of corrective and preventive actions.

I. Electronic Signature Electronic records may be signed electronically. Electronic signatures are expected to:

a, have the same impact as hand-written signatures within the boundaries of the company, b. be permanently linked to their respective record, c. include the time and date that they were applied.

J. Batch release

When a computerised system is used for recording certification and batch release, the system should allow only Authorised Persons to certify the release of the batches and it should clearly identify and record the person releasing or certifying the batches. This should be performed using an electronic signature.

K. Business Continuity

For the availability of computerised systems supporting critical processes, provisions should be made to ensure continuity of support for those processes in the event of a system breakdown (e.g. a manual or alternative system). The time required to bring the alternative arrangements into use should be based on risk and appropriate for a particular system and the business process it supports. These arrangements should be adequately documented and tested.

L. Archiving
Data may be archived. This data should be checked for accessibility, readability and integrity. If relevant changes are to be made to the system (e.g. computer equipment or programs), then the ability to retrieve the data should be ensured and tested.

# USE OF IONISING RADIATION IN THE MANUFACTURE OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS

## **INTRODUCTION**

Ionising radiation may be used during the manufacturing process for various purposes including the reduction of bioburden and the sterilisation of starting materials, packaging components or products and the treatment of blood products..

There are two types of irradiation process: Gamma irradiation from a radioactive source and high energy Electron irradiation (Beta radiation) from an accelerator.

Gamma irradiation: two different processing modes may be employed:

(i) Batch mode: the products is arranged at fixed locations around the radiation source and cannot be loaded or unloaded while the radiation source is exposed..
(ii) Continuous mode: an automatic system conveys the products into the radiation cell, past. the exposed radiation source along a defined path and at an appropriate speed, and out. of the cell.

Electron irradiation: the product is conveyed past a continuous or pulsed beam of high energy electrons (Beta radiation) which is scanned back and forth across the product pathway.

## RESPONSIBILITIES

M. Treatment by irradiation may be carried out by the pharmaceutical manufacturer or by an operator of a radiation facility under contract (a "contract manufacturer"), both of whom must hold an appropriate manufacturing authorisation.

N. The pharmaceutical manufacturer bears responsibility for the quality of the product.
including the attainment of the objective of irradiation. The contract operator of the radiation.
facility bears responsibility for ensuring that the dose of radiation required by the manufacturer is delivered to the irradiation container (i.e. the outermost container in which.
the products are irradiated).

O. The required dose including justified limits will be stated in the marketing authorisation for the product.

## DOSIMETRY

P. Dosimetry is defined as the measurement of the absorbed dose by the use of dosimeters.
Both understanding and correct use of the technique is essential for the validation,.
commissioning and control of the process..

Q. The calibration of each batch of routine dosimeters should be traceable to a national or international standard. The period of validity of the calibration should be stated, justified and adhered to.

R. The same instrument should normally be used to establish the calibration curve of the routine dosimeters and to measure the change in their absorbance after irradiation. If a different instrument is used, the absolute absorbance of each instrument should be established.

S. Depending on the type of dosimeter used, due account should be taken of possible causes of inaccuracy including the change in moisture content, change in temperature, time elapsed between irradiation and measurement, and the dose rate. T. The wavelength of the instrument used to measure the change in absorbance of dosimeters and the instrument used to measure their thickness should be subject to regular checks of calibration at intervals established on the basis of stability, purpose and usage.

## VALIDATION OF THE PROCESS

U. Validation is the action of proving that the process, i.e. the delivery of the intended absorbed dose to the product, will achieve the expected results.

V. Validation should include dose mapping to establish the distribution of absorbed dose within the irradiation container when packed with product in a defined configuration.

W. An irradiation process specification should include at least the following:

a) details of the packaging of the product;
b) the loading pattern(s) of product within the irradiation container. Particular care needs. to be taken, when a mixture of products is allowed in the irradiation container, that there is no underdosing of dense product or shadowing of other products by dense product. Each mixed product arrangement must be specified and validated;.
c) the loading pattern of irradiation containers around the source (batch mode) or the pathway through the cell (continuous mode);
d) maximum and minimum limits of absorbed dose to the product [and associated routine dosimetry];
e) maximum and minimum limits of absorbed dose to the irradiation container and. associated routine dosimetry to monitor this absorbed dose;
f) other process parameters, including dose rate, maximum time of exposure, number of exposures, etc.
When irradiation is supplied under contract at least parts (d) and (e) of the irradiation.
process specification should form part of that contract.

## COMMISSIONING OF THE PLANT

## General

X. Commissioning is the exercise of obtaining and documenting evidence that the irradiation plant will perform consistently within predetermined limits when operated according to the process specification. In the context of this annex, predetermined limits are the maximum and minimum doses designed to be absorbed by the irradiation container. It must not be possible for variations to occur in the operation of the plant which give a dose to the container outside these limits without the knowledge of the operator.

Y. Commissioning should include the following elements:

a. Design;

b. Dose mapping;
c. Documentation;
d. Requirement for re-commissioning.

## Gamma irradiators

Design

Z. The absorbed dose received by a particular part of an irradiation container at any specific point in the irradiator depends primarily on the following factors:

a) the activity and geometry of the source;
b) the distance from source to container;
c) the duration of irradiation controlled by the timer setting or conveyor speed;
d) the composition and density of material, including other products, between the source and the particular part of the container.

A. The total absorbed dose will in addition depend on the path of containers through a continuous irradiator or the loading pattern in a batch irradiator, and on the number of exposure cycles.

B. For a continuous irradiator with a fixed path or a batch irradiator with a fixed loading pattern, and with a given source strength and type of product, the key plant parameter controlled by the operator is conveyor speed or timer setting.

## Dose Mapping

C. For the dose mapping procedure, the irradiator should be filled with irradiation containers packed with dummy products or a representative product of uniform density. Dosimeters should be placed throughout a minimum of three loaded irradiation containers which are passed through the irradiator, surrounded by similar containers or dummy products. If the product is not uniformly packed, dosimeters should be placed in a larger number of containers.

D. The positioning of dosimeters will depend on the size of the irradiation container. For example, for containers up to $1\mathrm{~x~}1\mathrm{~x~}0.5\mathrm{~m~}$ , a three-dimensional $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ grid throughout the container including the outside surfaces might be suitable. If the expected positions of the minimum and maximum dose are known from a previous irradiator performance.

characterisation, some dosimeters could be removed from regions of average dose and replaced to form a $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ grid in the regions of extreme dose.

E. The results of this procedure will give minimum and maximum absorbed doses in the product and on the container surface for a given set of plant parameters, product density and loading pattern.

F. Ideally, reference dosimeters should be used for the dose mapping exercise because of their greater precision. Routine dosimeters are permissible but it is advisable to place reference dosimeters beside them at the expected positions of minimum and maximum dose and at the routine monitoring position in each of the replicate irradiation containers. The observed values of dose will have an associated random uncertainty which can be estimated from the variations in replicate measurements.

G. The minimum observed dose, as measured by the routine dosimeters, necessary to ensure that all irradiation containers receive the minimum required dose will be set in the knowledge of the random variability of the routine dosimeters used.

H. Irradiator parameters should be kept constant, monitored and recorded during dose mapping. The records, together with the dosimetry results and all other records generated, should be retained.

## Electron Beam Irradiators

### Design

I. The absorbed dose received by a particular portion of an irradiated product depends
primarily on the following factors: a) the characteristics of the beam, which are: electron energy, average beam current, scan width and scan uniformity;. b) the conveyor speed; c) the product composition and density; d) the composition, density and thickness of material between the output window and the particular portion of product;. e) the output window to container distance.
J. Key parameters controlled by the operator are the characteristics of the beam and the
conveyor speed.

### Dose Mapping

K. For the dose mapping procedure, dosimeters should be placed between layers of. homogeneous absorber sheets making up a dummy product, or between layers of representative products of uniform density, such that at least ten measurements can be made within the maximum range of the electrons. Reference should also be made to sections 18 to 21.

L. Irradiator parameters should be kept constant, monitored and recorded during dose mapping. The records, together with the dosimetry results and all other records generated, should be retained.

### Re-commissioning

M. Commissioning should be repeated if there is a change to the process or the irradiator which could affect the dose distribution to the irradiation container (e.g. change of source pencils). The extent to re-commissioning depends on the extent of the change in the irradiator or the load that has taken place. If in doubt, re-commission.

## PREMISES

N. Premises should be designed and operated to segregate irradiated from non- irradiated.
containers to avoid their cross-contamination. Where materials are handled within closed.
irradiation containers, it may not be necessary to segregate pharmaceutical from non-.
pharmaceutical materials, provided there is no risk of the former being contaminated by the latt er.

Any possibility of contamination of the products by radionuclide from the source must be excluded.

## PROCESSING

O. Irradiation containers should be packed in accordance with the specified loading pattern(s) established during validation.

P. During the process, the radiation dose to the irradiation containers should be monitored using validated dosimetry procedures. The relationship between this dose and the dose absorbed by the product inside the container must have been established during process. validation and plant commissioning.

Q. Radiation indicators should be used as an aid to differentiating irradiated from nonirradiated containers. They should not be used as the sole means of differentiation or as an indication of satisfactory processing.

R. Processing of mixed loads of containers within the irradiation cell should only be done when it is known from commissioning trials or other evidence that the radiation dose received by individual containers remains within the limits specified.

S. When the required radiation dose is by design given during more than one exposure or passage through the plant, this should be with the agreement of the holder of the marketing authorisation and occur within a predetermined time period. Unplanned interruptions during irradiation should be notified to the holder of the marketing authorisation if this extends the irradiation process beyond a previously agreed period.

T. Non-irradiated products must be segregated from irradiated products at all times. Methods or doing this include the use of radiation indicators (31.) and appropriate design of premises (28.).

## Gamma irradiators

U. For continuous processing modes, dosimeters should be placed so that at least two are exposed in the irradiation at all times.
V. For batch modes, at least two dosimeters should be exposed in positions related to the minimum dose position.
W. For continuous process modes, there should be a positive indication of the correct position. of the source and an interlock between source position and conveyor movement. Conveyor speed should be monitored continuously and recorded.
X. For batch process modes source movement and exposure times for each batch should be. monitored and recorded.
Y. For a given desired dose, the timer setting or conveyor speed requires adjustment for. source decay and source additions. The period of validity of the setting or speed should be recorded and adhered to.

## Electron Beam Irradiators

Z. A dosimeter should be placed on every container.

AA. There should be continuous recording of average beam current, electron energy, scan-. width and conveyor speed. These variables, other than conveyor speed, need to be controlled. within the defined limits established during commissioning since they are liable to instantaneous change.

## DOCUMENTATION

A. The numbers of containers received, irradiated and dispatched should be reconciled with each other and with the associated documentation. Any discrepancy should be reported and resolved.

B. The irradiation plant operator should certify in writing the range of doses received by each irradiated container within a batch or delivery.
C. Process and control records for each irradiation batch should be checked and signed by a nominated responsible person and retained. The method and place or retention should be agreed between the plant operator and the holder of the marketing authorisation.
D. The documentation associated with the validation and commissioning of the plant should be retained for one year after the expiry date or at least five years after the release of the last product processed by the plant, whichever is the longer.

## MICROBIOLOGICAL MONITORING

E. Microbiological monitoring is the responsibility of the pharmaceutical manufacturer. It may include environmental monitoring where product is manufactured and pre-irradiation monitoring of the product as specified in the marketing authorisation.

# MANUFACTURE OF INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS

## PRINCIPLE

Investigational medicinal products should be produced in accordance with Annex 1 and Annex 4-2 of Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc. (Annex 3 for Biological Products, Annex 3-2 for Radiopharmaceuticals and Annex 3-3 for Medicinal Gases). Other guidelines should be taken into account where relevant and as appropriate to the stage of development of the product. Procedures need to be flexible to provide for changes as knowledge of the process increases, and appropriate to the stage of development of the product.

In clinical trials there may be added risk to participating subjects compared to patients treated with marketed products. The application of GMP to the manufacture of investigational. medicinal products is intended to ensure that trial subjects are not placed at risk, and that the results of clinical trials are unaffected by inadequate safety, quality or efficacy arising from. unsatisfactory manufacture. Equally, it is intended to ensure that there is consistency between batches of the same investigational medicinal product used in the same or different clinical trials, and that changes during the development of an investigational medicinal product are adequately documented and justified.

The production of investigational medicinal products involves added complexity in comparison to marketed products by virtue of the lack of fixed routines, variety of clinical trial designs, consequent packaging designs, the need, often, for randomisation and blinding. and increased risk of product crosscontamination and mix up. Furthermore, there may be incomplete knowledge of the potency and toxicity of the product and a lack of full process validation, or, marketed products may be used which have been re-packaged or modified in some way.

These challenges require personnel with a thorough understanding of, and training in, the application of GMP to investigational medicinal products. Cooperation is required with trial. sponsors who undertake the ultimate responsibility for all aspects of the clinical trial. including the quality of investigational medicinal products..

The increased complexity in manufacturing operations requires a highly effective quality system.

The annex also includes guidance on ordering, shipping, and returning clinical supplies, which are at the interface with, and complementary to, guidelines on Good Clinical Practice.

### Notes

Non-investigational medicinal product

Products other than the test product, placebo or comparator may be supplied to subjects participating in a trial. Such products may be used as support or escape medication for. preventative, diagnostic or therapeutic reasons and/or needed to ensure that adequate medical. care is provided for the subject. They may also be used in accordance with the protocol to induce a physiological response. These products do not fall within the definition of. investigational medicinal products and may be supplied by the sponsor, or the investigator. The sponsor should ensure that they are in accordance with the notification/request for authorisation to conduct the trial and that they are of appropriate quality for the purposes of. the trial taking into account the source of the materials, whether or not they are the subject of a marketing authorisation and whether they have been repackaged. The advice and involvement of an Authorised Person is recommended in this task..

Manufacturing authorisation and reconstitution Both the total and partial manufacture of investigational medicinal products, as well as the. various processes of dividing up, packaging or presentation, is subject to a manufacturing. authorisation. This authorisation, however, shall not be required for reconstitution. For the purpose of this provision, reconstitution shall be understood as a simple process of:.

21) dissolving or dispersing the investigational medicinal product for administration of the product to a trial subject, or,

22) diluting or mixing the investigational medicinal product(s) with some other substance(s) used as a vehicle for the purposes of administering it.

Reconstitution is not mixing several ingredients, including the active substance, together to produce the investigational medicinal product.

An investigational medicinal product must exist before a process can be defined as reconstitution.

The process of reconstitution has to be undertaken as soon as practicable before administration.

This process has to be defined in the clinical trial application / IMP dossier and clinical trial protocol, or related document, available at the site.

## GLOSSARY

### Blinding

A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are kept unaware of the treatment assignment(s). Single-blinding usually refers to the subject(s) being unaware, and doubleblinding usually refers to the subject(s), investigator(s), monitor, and, in some cases, data analyst(s) being unaware of the treatment assignment(s). In relation to an investigational medicinal product, blinding means the deliberate disguising of the identity of the product in accordance with the instructions of the sponsor. Unblinding means the disclosure of the identity of blinded products.

### Clinical trial

Any investigation in human subjects intended to discover or verify the clinical, pharmacological and/or other pharmacodynamic effects of an investigational product(s) and/or to identify any adverse reactions to an investigational product(s), and/or to study absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of one or more investigational medicinal product(s) with the object of ascertaining its/their safety and/or efficacy.

### Comparator product

An investigational or marketed product (i.e. active control), or placebo, used as a reference in a clinical trial.

### Investigational medicinal product

A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorisation when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorised form, or when used for an unauthorised indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorised form.

### Investigator

A person responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. If a trial is conducted by a team of individuals at a trial site, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team and may be called the principal investigator.

### Manufacturer/importer of Investigational Medicinal Products

Any holder of the authorisation to manufacture/import.

### Order

Instruction to process, package and/or ship a certain number of units of investigational medicinal product(s).

### Product Specification File

A reference file containing, or referring to files containing, all the information necessary to draft the detailed written instructions on processing, packaging, quality control testing, batch release and shipping of an investigational medicinal product.

### Randomisation

The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce bias.

### Randomisation Code

A listing in which the treatment assigned to each subject from the randomisation process is identified.

### Shipping

The operation of packaging for shipment and sending of ordered medicinal products for clinical trials.

### Sponsor

An individual, company, institution or organisation which takes responsibility for the initiation, management and/or financing of a clinical trial..

## QUALITY MANAGEMENT

F. The Quality System, designed, set up and verified by the manufacturer or importer, should be described in written procedures available to the sponsor, taking into account the GMP. principles and guidelines applicable to investigational medicinal products..

G. The product specifications and manufacturing instructions may be changed during development but full control and traceability of the changes should be maintained.

## PERSONNEL

H. All personnel involved with investigational medicinal products should be appropriately trained in the requirements specific to these types of product..
Even in cases where the number of staff involved is small, there should be, for each batch, separate people responsible for production and quality control.
I. The Authorised Person should ensure that there are systems in place that meet the requirements of GMP and have a broad knowledge of pharmaceutical development and. clinical trial processes. Guidance for the Authorised Person in connection with the certification of investigational medicinal products is given in paragraphs 38 to 41.

## PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

J. The toxicity, potency and sensitising potential may not be fully understood for. investigational medicinal products and this reinforces the need to minimise all risks of crosscontamination. The design of equipment and premises, inspection. $/$ test methods and acceptance limits to be used after cleaning should reflect the nature of these risks. Consideration should be given to campaign working where appropriate. Account should be. taken of the solubility of the product in decisions about the choice of cleaning solvent..

## DOCUMENTATION

### Specifications and instructions

K. Specifications (for starting materials, primary packaging materials, intermediate, bulk. products and finished products), manufacturing formulae and processing and packaging. instructions should be as comprehensive as possible given the current state of knowledge. They should be periodically re-assessed during development and updated as necessary. Each new version should take into account the latest data, current technology used, regulatory and pharmacopoeial requirements, and should allow traceability to the previous document. Any changes should be carried out according to a written procedure, which should address any implications for product quality such as stability and bio equivalence.

L. Rationales for changes should be recorded and the consequences of a change on product quality and on any on-going clinical trials should be investigated and documented.

### Order

M. The order should request the processing and/or packaging of a certain number of units and/or their shipping and be given by or on behalf of the sponsor to the manufacturer. It should be in writing (though it may be transmitted by electronic means), and precise enough to avoid any ambiguity. It should be formally authorised and refer to the Product Specification File and the relevant clinical trial protocol as appropriate.

### Product specification file

N. The Product Specification File (see glossary) should be continually updated as development of the product proceeds, ensuring appropriate traceability to the previous versions. It should include, or refer to, the following documents:

23) Specifications and analytical methods for starting materials, packaging materials, intermediate, bulk and finished product; 24) Manufacturing methods; 25) In-process testing and methods; 26) Approved label copy; 27) Relevant clinical trial protocols and randomisation codes, as appropriate; 28) Relevant technical agreements with contract givers, as appropriate; 29) Stability data; 30) Storage and shipment conditions. The above listing is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive. The contents will vary depending on the product and stage of development. The information should form the basis for assessment of the suitability for certification and release of a particular batch by the Authorised Person and should therefore be accessible to him/her. Where different manufacturing steps are carried out at different locations under the responsibility of different Authorised Persons, it is acceptable to maintain separate files limited to information of relevance to the activities at the respective locations.

### Manufacturing formulae and processing instructions

O. For every manufacturing operation or supply there should be clear and adequate written instructions and written records. Where an operation is not repetitive it may not be necessary to produce Master Formulae and Processing Instructions. Records are particularly important for the preparation of the final version of the documents to be used in routine manufacture once the marketing authorisation is granted.

P. The information in the Product Specification File should be used to produce the detailed written instructions on processing, packaging, quality control testing, storage conditions and shipping.

### Packaging instructions

Q. Investigational medicinal products are normally packed in an individual way for each subject included in the clinical trial. The number of units to be packaged should be specified prior to the start of the packaging operations, including units necessary for carrying out quality control and any retention samples to be kept. Sufficient reconciliations should take place to ensure the correct quantity of each product required has been accounted for at each stage of processing.

### Processing, testing and packaging batch records

R. Batch records should be kept in sufficient detail for the sequence of operations to be accurately determined. These records should contain any relevant remarks which justify the procedures used and any changes made, enhance knowledge of the product and develop the manufacturing operations.

S. Batch manufacturing records should be retained at least for the periods specified in relevant regulations.

## PRODUCTION

### Packaging materials

T. Specifications and quality control checks should include measures to guard against. unintentional unblinding due to changes in appearance between different batches of packaging materials.

### Manufacturing operations

U. During development critical parameters should be identified and in-process controls primarily used to control the process. Provisional production parameters and in-process controls may be deduced from prior experience, including that gained from earlier development work. Careful consideration by key personnel is called for in order to formulate the necessary instructions and to adapt them continually to the experience gained in production. Parameters identified and controlled should be justifiable based on knowledge available at the time.

V. Production processes for investigational medicinal products are not expected to be validated to the extent necessary for routine production but premises and equipment are expected to be qualified. For sterile products, the validation of sterilising processes should be of the same standard as for products authorised for marketing. Likewise, when required, virus inactivation/removal and that of other impurities of biological origin should be demonstrated, to assure the safety of biotechnologically derived products, by following the scientific principles and techniques defined in the available guidance in this area.

W. Validation of aseptic processes presents special problems when the batch size is small; in these cases the number of units filled may be the maximum number filled in production. If practicable, and otherwise consistent with simulating the process, a larger number of units should be filled with media to provide greater confidence in the results obtained. Filling and sealing is often a manual or semi-automated operation presenting great challenges to sterility so enhanced attention should be given to operator training, and validating the aseptic

technique of individual operators.

### Principles applicable to comparator product

X. If a product is modified, data should be available (e.g. stability, comparative dissolution,. bioavailability) to demonstrate that these changes do not significantly alter the original quality characteristics of the product.

Y. The expiry date stated for the comparator product in its original packaging might not be applicable to the product where it has been repackaged in a different container that may not offer equivalent protection, or be compatible with the product. A suitable use-by date, taking into account the nature of the product, the characteristics of the container and the storage conditions to which the article may be subjected, should be determined by or on behalf of the sponsor. Such a date should be justified and must not be later than the expiry date of the original package. There should be compatibility of expiry dating and clinical trial duration.

### Blinding operations

Z. Where products are blinded, systems should be in place to ensure that the blind is achieved and maintained while allowing for identification of "blinded' products when necessary,. including the batch numbers of the products before the blinding operation. Rapid identification of product should also be possible in an emergency..

### Randomisation code

A. Procedures should describe the generation, security, distribution, handling and retention of any randomisation code used for packaging investigational products, and code-break mechanisms. Appropriate records should be maintained.

### Packaging

B. During packaging of investigational medicinal products, it may be necessary to handle different products on the same packaging line at the same time. The risk of product mix up must be minimised by using appropriate procedures and/or, specialised equipment as appropriate and relevant staff training.

C. Packaging and labelling of investigational medicinal products are likely to be more complex and more liable to errors (which are also harder to detect) than for marketed products, particularly when "blinded' products with similar appearance are used. Precautions against mis-labelling such as label reconciliation, line clearance, in-process control checks. by appropriately trained staff should accordingly be intensified.

D. The packaging must ensure that the investigational medicinal product remains in good condition during transport and storage at intermediate destinations. Any opening or tampering of the outer packaging during transport should be readily discernible.

### Labelling

E. Labelling of investigational medicinal products is intended to secure "protection of the trial subjects and traceability of the products", enable "identification of clinical trials and the. products" and promote "appropriate use of the products, and should include the following.

information:

a) "For clinical trial use only" or similar wording,
b) pharmaceutical dosage form, route of administration, quantity of dosage units, and in the case of open trials, the name/identifier and strength/potency;.
c) the batch and/or code number to identify the contents and packaging operation;
d) name, address and telephone number of the sponsor, contract research organisation or investigator (the main contact for information on the product, clinical trial and emergency unblinding);
e) period of use (use-by date, expiry date or re-test date as applicable) (it is possible to put in month/year format if it is traceable by using the centralized electronic randomization system);
f) the storage conditions;.
g) "keep out of reach of children' except when the product is for use in trials where the product is not taken home by subjects;.
h) a trial reference code allowing identification of the trial, site, investigator and sponsor if not given elsewhere;.
I) the trial subject identification number/treatment number and where relevant, the visit number; however, those numbers may not be included on labels after being. documented in the case the sponsor recognized that it is not necessary taking the characteristics of the clinical trial into account;.
j) the name of the investigator (if not included in (a) or (d));.
k) directions for use (reference may be made to a leaflet or other explanatory document intended for the trial subject or person administering the product)

F. The address and telephone number of the main contact for information on the product, clinical trial and for emergency unblinding need not appear on the label where the subject has been given a leaflet or card which provides these details and has been instructed to keep this in their possession at all times.

G. The particulars listed in Article 26 should appear on the primary packaging and on the secondary packaging (except for the cases described in Articles 29 and 30)..

H. When the product is to be provided to the trial subject or the person administering the medication within a primary packaging together with secondary packaging that is intended to remain together, and the secondary packaging carries the particulars listed in paragraph 26, the following information should be included on the label of the primary package (or any sealed dosing device that contains the primary packaging):

a) "For clinical trial use only' or similar wording;
b) the name/identifier of the products (including both the test product and comparator for blinding tests, and only the relevant group for open trials). If necessary, pharmaceutical dosage form, route of administration, quantity of dosage units, and strength/potency of active substances;
c) batch and/or code number to identify the contents and packaging operation;
d) name of sponsor, contract research organisation or investigator;
e) a trial reference code allowing identification of the trial, site, investigator and sponsor if not given elsewhere;
f) the trial subject identification number/treatment number and where relevant, the visit number; however, those numbers may not be included on labels after being documented in the case the sponsor recognized that it is not necessary taking the characteristics of the clinical trial into account.

1. If the primary packaging takes the form of blister packs or small units such as ampoules on which the particulars required in paragraph 26 cannot be displayed, outer packaging should be provided bearing a label with those particulars. The immediate container should nevertheless contain the following:

a) "For clinical trial use only" or similar wording;
b) the name/identifier of the products (including both the test product and comparator for blinding tests, and only the relevant group for open trials). If necessary,. pharmaceutical dosage form, route of administration, quantity of dosage units, and. strength/potency of active substances;
c) batch and/or code number to identify the contents and packaging operation;.
d) name of sponsor, contract research organisation or investigator;
e) a trial reference code allowing identification of the trial, site, investigator and sponsor if not given elsewhere;
f) the trial subject identification number/treatment number and where relevant, the visit number; however, those numbers may not be included on labels after being. documented in the case the sponsor recognized that it is not necessary taking the characteristics of the clinical trial into account;
g) period of use (use-by date, expiry date or re-test date as applicable); however, it may not be included in the case it can be controlled by using the centralized electronic randomization system. J. Symbols or pictograms may be included to clarify certain information mentioned above.
Additional information, warnings and/or handling instructions may be displayed.

K. If it becomes necessary to change the use-by date, an additional label should be affixed to the investigational medicinal product. This additional label should state the new use-by date and repeat the batch number. It may be superimposed on the old use-by date, but for quality control reasons, not on the original batch number. This operation should be performed at an appropriately authorised manufacturing site. However, when justified, it may be performed. at the investigational site by or under the supervision of the clinical trial site pharmacist, or other health care professional in accordance with national regulations. Where this is not possible, it may be performed by the clinical trial monitor(s) who should be appropriately. trained. The operation should be performed in accordance with GMP principles, specific and. standard operating procedures and under contract, if applicable, and should be checked by a second person. This additional labelling should be properly documented in both the trial. documentation and in the batch records.

## QUALITY CONTROL

L. As processes may not be standardised or fully validated, testing takes on more importance in ensuring that each batch meets its specification.

M. Quality control should be performed in accordance with the Product Specification File and in accordance with the required information. Verification of the effectiveness of blinding. should be performed and recorded.

N. Samples are retained to fulfil two purposes; firstly to provide a sample for analytical testing and secondly to provide a specimen of the finished product. Samples may therefore. fall into two categories:

Reference sample: a sample of a batch of starting material, packaging material, product contained in its primary packaging or finished product which is stored for the purpose of being analysed should the need arise. Where stability permits, reference samples from critical intermediate stages (e.g. those requiring analytical testing and release) or intermediates, which are transported outside of the manufacturer's control should be kept.

Retention sample: a sample of a packaged unit from a batch of finished product for each packaging run/trial period. It is stored for identification purposes. For example, presentation,. packaging, labelling, leaflet, batch number, expiry date should the need arise..

In many instances the reference and retention samples will be presented identically, i.e. as fully packaged units. In such circumstances, reference and retention samples may be regarded as interchangeable.

Reference and retention samples of investigational medicinal product, including blinded product should be kept for at least two years after completion or formal discontinuation of the last clinical trial in which the batch was used, whichever period is the longer.

Consideration should be given to keeping retention samples until the clinical report has been prepared to enable confirmation of product identity in the event of, and as part of an investigation into inconsistent trial results.

O. The storage location of Reference and Retention samples should be defined in a Technical Agreement between the sponsor and manufacturer(s) and should allow timely access by the competent authorities.

The reference sample should be of sufficient size to permit the carrying out, on, at least, two occasions, of the full analytical controls on the batch in accordance with the IMP dossier submitted for authorisation to conduct the clinical trial.

In the case of retention samples, it is acceptable to store information related to the final packaging as written or electronic records if such records provide sufficient information. In the case of the latter, the system should comply with the requirements of Annex 9..

## RELEASE OF BATCHES

P. Release of investigational medicinal products (see paragraph 42) should not occur until after the Authorised Person has certified that the relevant requirements have been met. The Authorised Person should take into account the elements listed in paragraph 39 as appropriate.

Q. 39. Assessment of each batch for certification prior to release may include as appropriate: 31) batch records, including control reports, in-process test reports and release reports demonstrating compliance with the product specification file, the order, protocol and randomisation code. These records should include all deviations or planned changes, and any consequent additional checks or tests, and should be completed and endorsed

by the staff authorised to do so according to the quality system;
32) production conditions;
33) the validation status of facilities, processes and methods;
34) examination of finished packs;
35) where relevant, the results of any analyses or tests performed after importation; 36) stability reports;
37) the source and verification of conditions of storage and shipment;.
38) audit reports concerning the quality system of the manufacturer;.
39) Documents certifying that the manufacturer is authorised to manufacture investigational medicinal products or comparators for export by the appropriate authorities in the country of export;
40) where relevant, regulatory requirements for marketing authorisation, GMP standards applicable and any official verification of GMP compliance;.
41) all other factors of which the QP is aware that are relevant to the quality of the batch. The relevance of the above elements is affected by the country of origin of the product, the manufacturer, and the marketed status of the product (with or without a marketing authorisation, in the EU or in a third country) and its phase of development..
The sponsor should ensure that the elements taken into account by the Authorised Person when certifying the batch are consistent with the required information. See also 43.

R. 40. Where investigational medicinal products are manufactured and packaged at different sites under the supervision of different Authorised Persons, recommendations should be. followed as applicable.

S. 41. Where, permitted in accordance with local regulations, packaging or labelling is carried out at the investigator site by, or under the supervision of a clinical trials pharmacist, or other health care professional as allowed in those regulations, the Authorised Person is not required to certify the activity in question. The sponsor is nevertheless responsible for ensuring that the activity is adequately documented and carried out in accordance with the principles of GMP and should seek the advice of the Authorised Person in this regard.

## SHIPPING

T. 42. Investigational medicinal products should remain under the control of the Sponsor. until after completion of a two-step procedure: certification by the Authorised Person;

and release following fulfilment of the relevant requirements. The Sponsor should ensure that the details set out in the clinical trial application and considered by the Authorised. Person are consistent withwhat is finally accepted by the Competent Authorities. Suitable arrangements to meet this requirement should be established. In practical terms, this can best be achieved through a change control process for the Product Specification File and defined in a Technical Agreement between the Authorised Person and the Sponsor. Both steps should be recorded and retained in the relevant trial files held by or on behalf of the sponsor.

U. 43. Shipping of investigational products should be conducted according to instructions given by or on behalf of the sponsor in the shipping order..

V. 44. De-coding arrangements should be available to the appropriate responsible personnel before investigational medicinal products are shipped to the investigator site.

W. 45. A detailed inventory of the shipments made by the manufacturer or importer should be maintained. It should particularly mention the addressees' identification..

X. 46. Transfers of investigational medicinal products from one trial site to another should remain the exception. Such transfers should be covered by standard operating procedures.. The product history while outside of the control of the manufacturer, through for example, trial monitoring reports and records of storage conditions at the original trial site should be reviewed as part of the assessment of the product's suitability for transfer and the advice of the Authorised Person should be sought. The product should be returned to the manufacturer, or another authorised manufacturer for re-labelling, if necessary, and certification by a Authorised Person. Records should be retained and full traceability ensured.

## COMPLAINTS

Y. 47. The conclusions of any investigation carried out in relation to a complaint which could. arise from the quality of the product should be discussed between the manufacturer or. importer and the sponsor (if different). This should involve the Authorised Person and. those responsible for the relevant clinical trial in order to assess any potential impact on the trial, product development and on subjects. This procedure should be documented.

## RECALLS AND RETURNS

### Recalls

Z. 48. Procedures for retrieving investigational medicinal products and documenting this retrieval should be agreed by the sponsor, in collaboration with the manufacturer or. importer where different. The investigator and monitor need to understand their. obligations under the retrieval procedure..
A. 49. The Sponsor should ensure that the supplier of any comparator or other medication to.
be used in a clinical trial has a system for communicating to the Sponsor the need to recall
any product supplied.

### Returns

B. 50. Investigational medicinal products should be returned on agreed conditions defined

by the sponsor, specified in approved written procedures.

C. 51. Returned investigational medicinal products should be clearly identified and stored in an appropriately controlled, dedicated area. Inventory records of the returned medicinal products should be kept.

## DESTRUCTION

D.52. The Sponsor is responsible for the destruction of unused and/or returned investigational medicinal products. Investigational medicinal products should therefore not be destroyed without prior written authorisation by the Sponsor. The records of destruction should be made and kept by each trial, including supporting documents and the name, batch number and use-by-date of the investigational medicinal products, the name of the trial site that returned products, patient numbers (or randomization code) and the actual quantities destroyed.

E. 53. The delivered, used and recovered quantities of product should be recorded, reconciled and verified by or on behalf of the sponsor for each trial site and each trial period. Destruction of unused investigational medicinal products should be carried out for a given trial site or a given trial period only after any discrepancies have been investigated and satisfactorily explained and the reconciliation has been accepted. Recording of destruction operations should be carried out in such a manner that all operations may be accounted for. The records should be kept by the Sponsor.

F. 54. When destruction of investigational medicinal products takes place a dated certificate of, or receipt for destruction, should be provided to the sponsor. These documents should clearly identify, or allow traceability to, the batches and/or patient numbers involved and the actual quantities destroyed.

# MANUFACTURE OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM HUMAN BLOOD OR PLASMA

## GLOSSARY

### Blood

Blood means whole blood collected from a single (human) donor and processed either for transfusion or for further manufacturing.

### Blood component

A blood component means a therapeutic constituent of blood (red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma) that can be prepared by various methods, using conventional blood bank methodology (e.g. centrifugation, filtration, freezing). This does not include haematopoietic progenitor cells.

### Blood establishment

A blood establishment is any structure or body that is responsible for any aspect of the collection and testing of human blood and blood components, whatever their intended purpose, and their processing, storage and distribution when intended for transfusion.

### Blood products

A blood product means any therapeutic product derived from human blood or plasma.

### Fractionation, fractionation plant

Fractionation is the manufacturing process in a plant (fractionation plant) during which plasma components are separated/purified by various physical and chemical methods such as e.g. precipitation, chromatography.

### Good Practice guidelines

Good practice guidelines give interpretation on the national standards and specifications defined for quality systems in blood establishments.

### Medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma

Medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma are medicinal products based on blood constituents which are prepared industrially by public or private establishments.

### Plasma for fractionation

Plasma for fractionation is the liquid part of human blood remaining after separation of the cellular elements from blood collected in a container containing an anticoagulant, or separated by continuous filtration or centrifugation of anti-coagulated blood in an apheresis procedure; it is intended for the manufacture of plasma derived medicinal products, in particular albumin, coagulation factors and immunoglobulins of human origin and specified in the official compendia.

### Plasma Master File (PMF)

A Plasma Master File is a stand-alone document, which is separate from the dossier for marketing authorisation. It provides all relevant detailed information on the characteristics of the entire human plasma used as a starting material and/or a raw material for the manufacture of sub/intermediate fractions, constituents of the excipients and active substances, which are part of plasma, derived medicinal products or medical devices.

### Processing

Processing means any step in the preparation of blood component that is carried out between the collection of blood and the issuing of a blood component, e.g. separation and freezing of blood components. In this Annex, processing in addition refers to those operations performed at the blood establishment that are specific to plasma to be used for fractionation..

## Responsible Person (RP)

person responsible for securing that each batch of (biological) active substance or medicinal. product has been manufactured and checked in compliance with the laws in force and in. accordance with the specifications and/or requirements of the marketing authorisation. The RP is equivalent to the EU term "Qualified Person" ..

### Responsible Person (RP) for blood establishment

A person responsible for ensuring that every unit of blood or blood components has been collected and tested, processed, stored and distributed in compliance with the laws in force. This term is equivalent to the EU term "Responsible Person".

### Contract fractionation program

This is a contract fractionation in a national plant of a fractionator/manufacturer, using starting material from other countries and manufacturing products not intended for the national market.

## 1. SCOPE

1.1 The provisions of this Annex apply to medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma, fractionated in or imported into the country. The Annex applies also to the starting material (e.g. human plasma) for these products. In line with national legislation the requirements may apply also for stable derivatives of human blood or human plasma (e.g. Albumin) incorporated into medical devices..
1.2 This Annex defines specific Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements for collection, processing, storage and transport of human plasma used for fractionation and for the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma.
1.3 The Annex addresses specific provisions for when starting material is imported from other countries and for contract fractionation programs for other countries..
1.4 The Annex does not apply to blood components intended for transfusion..

## 2. PRINCIPLES

2.1 Medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma (and their active substances which are used as starting materials) must comply with Annex 1, Annex 3 and Annex 5 of Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc. as well as the relevant marketing. authorisation. They are considered to be biological medicinal products and the starting. materials include biological substances, such as cells or fluids (including blood or plasma) of human origin. Certain special features arise from the biological nature of the source material. For example, disease- transmitting agents, especially viruses, may. contaminate the source material. The quality and safety of these products relies therefore on the control of source materials and their origin as well as on the subsequent manufacturing procedures, including infectious marker testing, virus removal and virus. inactivation.

2.2 In principle active substances used as starting material for medicinal products must. comply with the principles and guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice (see 2.1). For starting materials derived from human blood and plasma national or international. requirements for blood establishments involved in the collection, preparation and testing are to be followed. Collection, preparation and testing must be performed in accordance with an appropriate quality system and for which standards and specifications are defined. Furthermore, the national or international requirements on traceability and. serious adverse reactions and serious adverse event notifications from the donor to the recipient should be applied. Reference is hereby made to international guidelines as. defined in the addendum. In addition the monographs of the relevant Pharmacopoeia are to be observed.

2.3 Starting material for the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma imported from other countries and intended for use or distribution within the. country must meet the national standards.

2.4 In the case of contract fractionation programs the starting material imported from other. countries must comply with the national or equivalent quality and safety requirements for blood components. The activities conducted within the country must fully comply. with GMP. Consideration should be given to national standards and specifications relating to a quality system for blood establishments, the traceability requirements and notification of serious adverse reactions and events and the relevant WHO guidelines and recommendations as listed in the addendum..

2.5 All subsequent steps after collection and testing (e.g. processing (including separation),. freezing, storage and transport to the manufacturer) must therefore be done in accordance with the principles and guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice. Normally, these activities would be carried out under the responsibility of a Responsible Person in an establishment with a manufacturing authorisation. Where specific processing steps in. relation to plasma for fractionation take place in a blood establishment, the specific appointment of a Responsible Person may, however, not be proportionate given the. presence and responsibility of a Responsible Person of the blood establishment. To. address this particular situation and to ensure the legal responsibilities of the Responsible Person are properly addressed, the fractionation plant/manufacturer should establish a contract in accordance with Chapter 7 of the GMP Guide with the blood establishment that defines respective responsibilities and the detailed requirements in order to ensure compliance. The Responsible Person of the blood establishment and the Responsible Person of the fractionation/manufacturing plant (see 3.5) should be involved in drawing. up this contract. The Responsible Person should ensure that audits are performed to confirm that the blood establishment complies with the contract..

2.6 Depending on national legislation, specific requirements for documentation and other arrangements relating to the starting material of plasma-derived medicinal products are defined in the Plasma Master File.

## 3. QUALITY MANAGEMENT

3.1 Quality management should govern all stages from donor selection in the blood establishment up to delivery of the finished product by the finished product manufacturer. Traceability of each donation up to and including the delivery of plasma to the fractionation plant should be ensured by the blood establishment through accurate identification procedures, record maintenance and an appropriate labelling system according to national or international requirements, and should be maintained during further manufacturing and distribution of final products by the manufacturer.

3.2 Blood or plasma used as source material for the manufacture of medicinal products must. be collected and processed by blood establishments and be tested in laboratories which. apply quality systems in accordance with national or international standards. Reference. is made to documents listed in the addendum. The blood establishments have to be authorised and subject to regular inspections by a national competent authority. Contract. fractionation programs have to be notified to the competent authority by the manufacturer..

3.3 If plasma is imported from other countries it should only be purchased from approved. suppliers (e.g. blood establishments, including external warehouses). They should be named. in the specifications for starting materials as defined by the fractionation plant/manufacturer, and be accepted by the competent authority (e.g. following an inspection) of the importing country and by the Responsible Person of the importing fractionation plant.. Certification and release of plasma (plasma for fractionation) as starting material is mentioned in section 6.8.

3.4 Supplier qualification, including audits, should be performed by the fractionation plant/manufacturer of the finished product including test laboratory according to written procedures. Re-qualification of suppliers should be performed at regular intervals taking a risk-based approach into account.

3.5 The fractionation plant/manufacturer of the finished product should establish written contracts with the supplying blood establishments. As a minimum the following key aspects should be addressed:

- definition of duties and respective responsibilities
- quality system and documentation requirements
- donor selection criteria and testing
- requirements for the separation of blood into blood components/plasma
- freezing of plasma
- storage and transport of plasma
- traceability and post donation / collection information (including adverse events).

The test results of all units supplied by the blood establishment should be available to the fractionation plant/manufacturer of the medicinal product. In addition, any fractionation step subcontracted should be defined in a written contract.

3.6 A formal change control system should be in place to plan, evaluate and document all changes that may affect the quality or safety of the products, or traceability. The potential impact of proposed changes should be evaluated. The need for additional testing and validation, especially viral inactivation and removal steps, should be determined.

3.7 An adequate safety strategy should be in place to minimise the risk from infectious agents and emerging infectious agents. This strategy should involve a risk assessment that: - defines an inventory holding time (internal quarantine time) before processing the plasma i.e. to remove look back units. - considers all aspects of virus reduction and/or testing for infectious agents or surrogates. - considers the virus reduction capabilities, the pool size and other relevant aspects of the manufacturing processes.

## 4. TRACEABILITY AND POST COLLECTION MEASURES

4.1 There must be a system in place that enables each donation to be traced, from the donor and the donation via the blood establishment through to the batch of medicinal product and vice versa.

4.2 Responsibilities for traceability of the product should be defined (there should be no gaps): - from the donor and the donation in the blood establishment to the fractionation plant (this is the responsibility of the RP of the blood establishment); - from the fractionation plant to the manufacturer of the medicinal product and any secondary facility, whether a manufacturer of a medicinal product or of a medical device (this is the responsibility of the RP)..
4.3 Data needed for full traceability must be stored according to national legislation.
4.4 The contracts (as mentioned in 3.5) between the blood establishments (including testing
1aboratories) and the fractionation plant/manufacturer should ensure that traceability and post collection measures cover the complete chain from the collection of the plasma to all manufacturers responsible for release of the final products.
4.5 The blood establishments should notify the fractionating plant/manufacturer of any event which may affect the quality or safety of the product including serious adverse events and reactions and other relevant information found subsequent to donor acceptance or release of the plasma, e.g. look back information (post-collection information). Where the fractionation plant/manufacturer is located in another country, the information should be forwarded to the manufacturer responsible for release in the country of any product manufactured from the plasma concerned. In both cases, if relevant for the quality or safety of the final product, this information should be forwarded to the competent authority responsible for the fractionation plant/manufacturer as required by national legislation.
4.6 The notification procedure as described in 4.5 also applies when an inspection of a blood establishment by a competent authority leads to a withdrawal of an existing licence/certificate/ approval.
4.7 The management of post-collection information should be described in standard operating procedures and taking into account obligations and procedures for informing the competent authorities. Post-collection measures should be available as defined in national or relevant international recommendations.
The blood establishment and the fractionation/manufacturer should inform each other if,
following donation:
- It is found that the donor did not meet the relevant donor health criteria;
- A subsequent donation from a donor previously found negative for viral markers is found positive for any of the viral markers;
- It is discovered that testing for viral markers has not been carried out according to agreed procedures;
- The donor has developed an infectious disease caused by an agent potentially transmissible by plasma-derived products (HBV, HCV, HAV and other non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis viruses, HIV-1 and 2 and other agents in the light of current knowledge);
- The donor develops Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD or vCJD);
- The recipient of blood or a blood component develops post-transfusion infection which implicates or can be traced back to the donor.
In the event of any of the above, a re-assessment of the batch documentation should
always be carried out. The need for withdrawal of the given batch should be carefully
considered, taking into account criteria such as the transmissible agent involved, the size
of the pool, the time period between donation and seroconversion, the nature of the
product and its manufacturing method.

## 5. PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

5.1 In order to minimise microbiological contamination or the introduction of foreign. material into the plasma pool, thawing and pooling of plasma units should be performed in an area conforming at least to the Grade D requirements defined in Annex 1 of this guide. Appropriate clothing should be worn including face masks and gloves. All other. open manipulations during the manufacturing process should be done under conditions conforming to the appropriate requirements of Annex 1 of this guide..

5.2 Environmental monitoring should be performed regularly, especially during the ' opening' of plasma containers, and during subsequent thawing and pooling processes in accordance with Annex 1 of this guide.

5.3 In the production of plasma-derived medicinal products, appropriate viral inactivation or removal procedures are used and steps should be taken to prevent cross contamination of treated with untreated products. Dedicated and distinct premises and equipment should be used for manufacturing steps before and after viral inactivation treatment.

5.4 To avoid placing routine manufacture at risk of contamination from viruses used during. validation studies, the validation of methods for virus reduction should not be conducted in production facilities. Validation should be performed according to international. recommendations.

## 6. MANUFACTURING

### Starting material

6.1 The starting material should comply with the requirements of all relevant monographs of the relevant Pharmacopoeia and of the conditions laid down in the respective marketing authorisation dossier (including the Plasma Master File if applicable). These requirements should be defined in the written contract (see 3.5) between the blood establishment and the fractionating plant/manufacturer and controlled through the quality system.
6.2 Starting material imported for contract fractionation programs should comply with the requirements as specified in 2.4.
6.3 Depending on the type of collection (i.e. either whole blood collection or automated apheresis) different processing steps may be required. All processing steps (e.g.. centrifugation and/or separation, sampling, labelling, freezing) should be defined in written procedures.
6.4 Any mix-ups of units and of samples, especially during labelling, as well as any. contamination, e.g. when cutting the tube segments/sealing the containers, must be avoided.
6.5 Freezing is a critical step for the recovery of proteins that are labile in plasma, e.g. clotting factors. Freezing should therefore be performed as soon as possible after collection (see the Specifications and Test Methods for Biological Products (MFDS Notification).
6.6 The storage and transport of blood or plasma at any stage in the transport chain to the fractionation plant should be defined and recorded. Any deviation from the defined temperature should be notified to the fractionation plant. Qualified equipment and validated procedures should be used.

### Certification/release of plasma for fractionation as starting material

6.7 Plasma for fractionation should only be released, i.e. from a quarantine status, through. systems and procedures that assure the quality needed for the manufacture of the finished. product. It should only be distributed to the plasma fractionation plant/manufacturer after. it has been documented by the Responsible Person of the blood establishment (or in case of blood/plasma collection in other countries by a person with equivalent responsibilities and qualifications) that the plasma for fractionation does comply with the requirements and specifications defined in the respective written contracts and that all steps have been performed in accordance with Good Practice and GMP Guidelines, as appropriate..

6.8 On entering the fractionation plant, the plasma units should be released for fractionation under the responsibility of the Responsible Person. The Responsible Person should. confirm that the plasma complies with the requirements of all relevant monographs and. the conditions laid down in the respective marketing authorisation dossier (including the. Plasma Master File if applicable) or, in case of plasma to be used for contract. fractionation programs, with the requirements as specified in 2.4.

### Processing of plasma for fractionation

6.9 The steps used in the fractionation process vary according to product and manufacturer and usually include several fractionation/purification procedures, some of which may contribute to the inactivation and/or removal of potential contamination.

6.10 Requirements for the processes of pooling, pool sampling and fractionation/purification and virus inactivation/removal should be defined and followed thoroughly.

6.11 The methods used in the viral inactivation process should be undertaken with strict adherence to validated procedures and in compliance with the methods used in the virus validation studies. Detailed investigation of failures in virus inactivation procedures should be performed. Adherence to the validated production process is especially. important in the virus reduction procedures as any deviation could result in a safety risk for the final product. Procedures which take this risk into consideration should be in place.
6.12 Any reprocessing or reworking may only be performed after a quality risk management. exercise has been performed and using processing steps as defined in the relevant marketing authorisation.
6.13 A system for clearly segregating/distinguishing between products or intermediates. which have undergone a process of virus reduction, from those which have not, should be in place.
6.14 Depending on the outcome of a thorough risk management process (taking into consideration possible differences in epidemiology) production in campaigns including clear segregation and defined validated cleaning procedures should be adopted when plasma/intermediates of different origins is processed at the same plant. The requirement for such measures should be based on international recommendations. The risk management process should consider whether it is necessary to use dedicated equipment in the case of contract fractionation programs.
6.15 For intermediate products intended to be stored, a shelf-life should be defined based on stability data.
6.16 The storage and transport of intermediate and finished medicinal products at any stage of the transport chain should be specified and recorded. Qualified equipment and validated procedures should be used.

## 7. QUALITY CONTROL

7.1 Testing requirements for viruses or other infectious agents should be considered in the light of knowledge emerging on infectious agents and on the availability of appropriate,. validated test methods.
7.2 The first homogeneous plasma pool (e.g. after separation of the cryoprecipitate from the plasma pool) should be tested using validated test methods of suitable sensitivity and specificity, according to the relevant Pharmacopoeia monographs.

## 8. RELEASE OF INTERMEDIATE AND FINISHED PRODUCTS

8.1 Only batches derived from plasma pools tested and found negative for virus markers / antibodies and found in compliance with the relevant Pharmacopoeia monographs,. including any specific virus cut-off limits, and with the approved specifications (e.g. Plasma Master File if applicable), should be released.
8.2 The release of intermediates intended for further in-house processing or delivery to a different site and the release of finished products should be performed by the Responsible Person and in accordance with the approved marketing authorisation.
8.3. The release of intermediates and final products used in contract fractionation programs should be performed by the Responsible Person on the basis of standards agreed with the contract giver and compliance with the GMP standards.

## 9. RETENTION OF PLASMA POOL SAMPLES

One plasma pool may be used to manufacture more than one batch and/or product. Retention samples and corresponding records from every pool should be kept for at least one year after the expiry date of the finished medicinal product with the longest shelf-life derived from the pool.

## 10. DISPOSAL OF WASTE

There should be written procedures for the safe and documented storage and disposal of waste, disposable and rejected items (e.g. contaminated units, units from infected donors, out of date blood, plasma, intermediate or finished products)..

# PARAMETRIC RELEASE

## 1. PRINCIPLE

1.1 The definition of Parametric Release used in this Annex is based on that proposed by the European Organization for Quality: "A system of release that gives the assurance that. the product is of the intended quality based on information collected during the. manufacturing process and on the compliance with specific GMP requirements related. to Parametric Release."

1.2 Parametric release should comply with the basic requirements of GMP, with applicable annexes and the following guidelines..

## 2. PARAMETRIC RELEASE

2.1 It is recognised that a comprehensive set of in-process tests and controls may provide greater assurance of the finished product meeting specification than finished product testing.

2.2 Parametric release may be authorised for certain specific parameters as an alternative to routine testing of finished products. Authorisation for parametric release should be given, refused or withdrawn jointly by those responsible for assessing products together with the GMP inspectors.

## 3. PARAMETRIC RELEASE FOR STERILE PRODUCTS

3.1 This section is only concerned with that part of Parametric Release which deals with the routine release of finished products without carrying out a sterility test. Elimination of the sterility test is only valid on the basis of successful demonstration that predetermined, validated sterilising conditions have been achieved.
3.2 A sterility test only provides an opportunity to detect a major failure of the sterility assurance system due to statistical limitations of the method.
3.3 Parametric release can be authorised if the data demonstrating correct processing of the batch provides sufficient assurance, on its own, that the process designed and validated to ensure the sterility of the product has been delivered.
3.4 At present Parametric release can only be approved for products terminally sterilized in. their final container.
3.5 Sterilization methods according to relevant compendia requirements using steam, dry heat and ionising radiation may be considered for parametric release.
3.6 It is unlikely that a completely new product would be considered as suitable for Parametric Release because a period of satisfactory sterility test results will form part of the acceptance criteria. There may be cases when a new product is only a minor variation, from the sterility assurance point of view, and existing sterility test data from other products could be considered as relevant.
3.7 A risk analysis of the sterility assurance system focused on an evaluation of releasing non-sterilised products should be performed.
3.8 The manufacturer should have a history of good compliance with GMP.
3.9 The history of non sterility of products and of results of sterility tests carried out on the product in question together with products processed through the same or a similar sterility assurance system should be taken into consideration when evaluating GMP compliance.
3.10 A qualified experienced sterility assurance engineer and a qualified microbiologist should normally be present on the site of production and sterilization..
3.11 The design and original validation of the product should ensure that integrity can be maintained under all relevant conditions..
3.12 The change control system should require review of change by sterility assurance personnel.
3.13 There should be a system to control microbiological contamination in the product before sterilisation.
3.14 There should be no possibility for mix ups between sterilised and non sterilised products. Physical barriers or validated electronic systems may provide such assurance..
3.15 The sterilization records should be checked for compliance to specification by at least two independent systems. These systems may consist of two people or a validated computer system plus a person.
3.16 The following additional items should be confirmed prior to release of each batch of product. 28) All planned maintenance and routine checks have been completed in the sterilizer used. 29) All repairs and modifications have been approved by the sterility assurance engineer and microbiologist. 30) All instrumentation was in calibration.. 31) The sterilizer had a current validation for the product load processed.
3.17 Once parametric release has been granted, decisions for release or rejection of a batch should be based on the approved specifications. Non-compliance with the specification for parametric release cannot be overruled by a pass of a sterility test.

## 4. GLOSSARY

### Parametric Release

A system of release that gives the assurance that the product is of the intended quality based on information collected during the manufacturing process and on the compliance with specific GMP requirements related to Parametric Release.

### Sterility Assurance System

The sum total of the arrangements made to assure the sterility of products. For terminally sterilized products these typically include the following stages:

1) Product design.
b) Knowledge of and, if possible, control of the microbiological condition of starting materials and process aids (e.g. gases and lubricants).
c) Control of the contamination of the process of manufacture to avoid the ingress of microorganisms and their multiplication in the product. This is usually accomplished by cleaning and sanitization of product contact surfaces, prevention of aerial contamination by handling in clean rooms, use of process control time limits and, if applicable, filtration stages.
d) Prevention of mix up between sterile and non sterile product streams.
e) Maintenance of product integrity..
f) The sterilization process.
g) The totality of the Quality System that contains the Sterility Assurance System e.g. change control, training, written procedures, release checks, planned preventative maintenance, failure mode analysis, prevention of human error, validation calibration, etc.

# GMP Guide for active pharmaceutical ingredients

## G. H. 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Objective

This document (Guide) is intended to provide guidance regarding good manufacturing practice (GMP) for the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) under an appropriate system for managing quality. It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.

In this Guide "manufacturing' includes all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and. distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term "should' indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable, modified in any relevant annexes to the GMP Guide, or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance.

The GMP Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are governed by national laws.

This Guide is not intended to define registration requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. All commitments in registration documents must be met.

### 1.2 Scope

This Guide applies to the manufacture of APIs for medicinal products for both human and veterinary use. It applies to the manufacture of sterile APIs only up to the point immediately prior to the APIs being rendered sterile. The sterilisation and aseptic processing of sterile APIs are not covered, but should be performed in accordance with Annex 1 of Regulations on Safety of Medicinal Products, etc. and Annex 1 of this regulation.

This Guide excludes whole blood and plasma. However, it does include APIs that are produced using blood or plasma as raw materials. Finally, the Guide does not apply to bulkpackaged medicinal products. It applies to all other active starting materials subject to any derogations described in the annexes to the GMP Guide, in particular Annexes 2 to 5 where supplementary guidance for certain types of API may be found.

Section 18 contains guidance that only applies to the manufacture of APIs used in the production of investigational medicinal products although it should be noted that its application in this case, although recommended, is not required in PIC/S countries..

An "API Starting Material"' is a raw material, intermediate, or an API that is used in the production of an API and that is incorporated as a significant structural fragment into the. structure of the API. An API Starting Material can be an article of commerce, a material purchased from one or more suppliers under contract or commercial agreement, or produced. in-house. API Starting Materials normally have defined chemical properties and structure.. The manufacturer should designate and document the rationale for the point at which. production of the API begins. For synthetic processes, this is known as the point at which "API Starting Materials" are entered into the process. For other processes (e.g. fermentation, extraction, purification, etc), this rationale should be established on a case-by-case basis. Table 1 gives guidance on the point at which the API Starting Material is normally introduced into the process.

From this point on, appropriate GMP as defined in this Guide should be applied to these intermediate and/or API manufacturing steps. This would include the validation of critical process steps determined to impact the quality of the API. However, it should be noted that the fact that a manufacturer chooses to validate a process step does not necessarily define that step as critical.

The guidance in this document would normally be applied to the steps shown in gray in Table 1. It does not imply that all steps shown should be completed. The stringency of GMP in API manufacturing should increase as the process proceeds from early API steps to final steps, purification, and packaging. Physical processing of APIs, such as granulation, coating or physical manipulation of particle size (e.g. milling, micronizing), should be conducted at least to the standards of this Guide.

This GMP Guide does not apply to steps prior to the introduction of the defined "API Starting Material"

## 2. QUALITY MANAGEMENT

### 2.1 Principles

2.10 Quality should be the responsibility of all persons involved in manufacturing.

2.11 Each manufacturer should establish, document, and implement an effective system for managing quality that involves the active participation of management and appropriate manufacturing personnel. procedures, processes and resources, as well as activities necessary to ensure confidence that the API will meet its intended specifications for quality and purity. All quality related activities should be defined and documented.
2.13 There should be a quality unit(s) that is independent of production and that fulfils both quality assurance $(Q A)$ and quality control $(Q C)$ responsibilities. This can be in the form of separate QA and QC units or a single individual or group, depending upon the size and structure of the organization.
2.14 The persons authorised to release intermediates and APIs should be specified.
2.15 All quality related activities should be recorded at the time they are performed.
2.16 Any deviation from established procedures should be documented and explained.. Critical deviations should be investigated, and the investigation and its conclusions should be documented.
2.17 No materials should be released or used before the satisfactory completion of evaluation by the quality unit(s) unless there are appropriate systems in place to allow for such use (e.g. release under quarantine as described in Section 10.20 or the use of raw materials or intermediates pending completion of evaluation).
2.18 Procedures should exist for notifying responsible management in a timely manner of regulatory inspections, serious GMP deficiencies, product defects and related actions (e.g. quality related complaints, recalls, regulatory actions, etc.).
2.19 To achieve the quality objective reliably there must be a comprehensively designed and. correctly implemented quality system incorporating Good Manufacturing Practice, Quality Control and Quality Risk Management.

### 2.2 Quality Risk Management

2.20 Quality risk management is a systematic process for the assessment, control, communication and review of risks to the quality of the active substance. It can be applied both proactively and retrospectively.

2.21 The quality risk management system should ensure that: - the evaluation of the risk to quality is based on scientific knowledge, experience with the process and ultimately links to the protection of the patient through communication with the user of the active substance.

the level of effort, formality and documentation of the quality risk management process is commensurate with the level of risk.

7.23 Large storage containers, and their attendant manifolds, filling and discharge lines should be appropriately identified.

7.24 Each container or grouping of containers (batches) of materials should be assigned and. identified with a distinctive code, batch, or receipt number. This number should be used. in recording the disposition of each batch. A system should be in place to identify the status of each batch.

### 7.3 Sampling and Testing of Incoming Production Materials

7.30 At least one test to verify the identity of each batch of material should be conducted, with the exception of the materials described below in 7.32. A supplier's Certificate of Analysis can be used in place of performing other tests, provided that the manufacturer has a system in place to evaluate suppliers.
7.31 Supplier approval should include an evaluation that provides adequate evidence (e.g., past quality history) that the manufacturer can consistently provide material meeting specifications. Full analyses should be conducted on at least three batches before reducing in-house testing. However, as a minimum, a full analysis should be performed at appropriate intervals and compared with the Certificates of Analysis. Reliability of Certificates of Analysis should be checked at regular intervals..
7.32 Processing aids, hazardous or highly toxic raw materials, other special materials, or materials transferred to another unit within the company's control do not need to be tested if the manufacturer's Certificate of Analysis is obtained, showing that these raw materials conform to established specifications. Visual examination of containers, labels, and recording of batch numbers should help in establishing the identity of these materials. The lack of on-site testing for these materials should be justified and documented.
7.33 Samples should be representative of the batch of material from which they are taken. Sampling methods should specify the number of containers to be sampled, which part of the container to sample, and the amount of material to be taken from each container. The number of containers to sample and the sample size should be based upon a sampling plan that takes into consideration the criticality of the material, material variability, past quality history of the supplier, and the quantity needed for analysis.
7.34 Sampling should be conducted at defined locations and by procedures designed to prevent contamination of the material sampled and contamination of other materials.
7.35 Containers from which samples are withdrawn should be opened carefully and subsequently reclosed. They should be marked to indicate that a sample has been taken.

### 7.4 Storage

7.40 Materials should be handled and stored in a manner to prevent degradation,. contamination, and cross-contamination.
7.41 Materials stored in fiber drums, bags, or boxes should be stored off the floor and, when appropriate, suitably spaced to permit cleaning and inspection.
7.42 Materials should be stored under conditions and for a period that have no adverse affect on their quality, and should normally be controlled so that the oldest stock is used first..
7.43 Certain materials in suitable containers can be stored outdoors, provided identifying
1abels remain legible and containers are appropriately cleaned before opening and use.
7.44 Rejected materials should be identified and controlled under a quarantine system designed to prevent their unauthorised use in manufacturing.

### 7.5 Re-evaluation

7.50 Materials should be re-evaluated as appropriate to determine their suitability for use (e.g., after prolonged storage or exposure to heat or humidity).

## 8. PRODUCTION AND IN-PROCESS CONTROLS

### 8.1 Production Operations

8.10 Raw materials for intermediate and API manufacturing should be weighed or measured under appropriate conditions that do not affect their suitability for use. Weighing and

measuring devices should be of suitable accuracy for the intended use. the material should be suitable and should be so identified that the following information is available: $\triangleright$ Material name and/or item code; > Receiving or control number; > Weight or measure of material in the new container, and > Re-evaluation or retest date if appropriate.
8.12 Critical weighing, measuring, or subdividing operations should be witnessed or subjected to an equivalent control. Prior to use, production personnel should verify that the materials are those specified in the batch record for the intended intermediate or API.
8.13 Other critical activities should be witnessed or subjected to an equivalent control.
8.14 Actual yields should be compared with expected yields at designated steps in the production process. Expected yields with appropriate ranges should be established based on previous laboratory, pilot scale, or manufacturing data. Deviations in yield associated with critical process steps should be investigated to determine their impact or potential impact on the resulting quality of affected batches.
8.15 Any deviation should be documented and explained. Any critical deviation should be investigated.
8.16 The processing status of major units of equipment should be indicated either on the individual units of equipment or by appropriate documentation, computer control systems, or alternative means.
8.17 Materials to be reprocessed or reworked should be appropriately controlled to prevent unauthorized use.

### 8.2 Time Limits

8.20 If time limits are specified in the master production instruction (see 6.41), these time limits should be met to ensure the quality of intermediates and APIs. Deviations should be documented and evaluated. Time limits may be inappropriate when processing to a target value (e.g., pH adjustment, hydrogenation, drying to predetermined specification) because completion of reactions or processing steps are determined by in-process sampling and testing.

8.21 Intermediates held for further processing should be stored under appropriate conditions to ensure their suitability for use.

### 8.3 In-process Sampling and Controls

8.30 Written procedures should be established to monitor the progress and control the performance of processing steps that cause variability in the quality characteristics of. intermediates and APIs. In-process controls and their acceptance criteria should be

defined based on the information gained during the development stage or historical data.
8.31 The acceptance criteria and type and extent of testing can depend on the nature of the intermediate or API being manufactured, the reaction or process step being conducted, and the degree to which the process introduces variability in the product's quality. Less stringent in-process controls may be appropriate in early processing steps, whereas tighter controls may be appropriate for later processing steps (e.g., isolation and. purification steps).
8.32 Critical in-process controls (and critical process monitoring), including the control points and methods, should be stated in writing and approved by the quality unit(s).
8.33 In-process controls can be performed by qualified production department personnel and. the process adjusted without prior quality unit(s) approval if the adjustments are made within pre-established limits approved by the quality unit(s). All tests and results should. be fully documented as part of the batch record.
8.34 Written procedures should describe the sampling methods for in-process materials, intermediates, and APIs. Sampling plans and procedures should be based on scientifically sound sampling practices.
8.35 In-process sampling should be conducted using procedures designed to prevent contamination of the sampled material and other intermediates or APIs. Procedures should be established to ensure the integrity of samples after collection.
8.36 Out-of-specification (OOs) investigations are not normally needed for inprocess tests that are performed for the purpose of monitoring and/or adjusting the process.

### 8.4 Blending Batches of Intermediates or APIs

8.40 For the purpose of this document, blending is defined as the process of combining. materials within the same specification to produce a homogeneous intermediate or API. In-process mixing of fractions from single batches (e.g., collecting several centrifuge. loads from a single crystallization batch) or combining fractions from several batches. considered to be blending.
8.41 Out-Of-Specification batches should not be blended with other batches for the purpose of meeting specifications. Each batch incorporated into the blend should have been manufactured using an established process and should have been individually tested and found to meet appropriate specifications prior to blending.
8.42 Acceptable blending operations include but are not limited to:. > Blending of small batches to increase batch size. > Blending of tailings (i.e., relatively small quantities of isolated material) from batches of the same intermediate or API to form a single batch..
8.43 Blending processes should be adequately controlled and documented and the blended batch should be tested for conformance to established specifications where appropriate.
8.44 The batch record of the blending process should allow traceability back to the individual.

batches that make up the blend.

8.45 Where physical attributes of the API are critical (e.g., APIs intended for use in solid oral dosage forms or suspensions), blending operations should be validated to show homogeneity of the combined batch. Validation should include testing of critical attributes (e.g., particle size distribution, bulk density, and tap density) that may be affected by the blending process.
8.46 If the blending could adversely affect stability, stability testing of the final blended. batches should be performed.
8.47 The expiry or retest date of the blended batch should be based on the manufacturing date of the oldest tailings or batch in the blend.

### 8.5 Contamination Control

8.50 Residual materials can be carried over into successive batches of the same intermediate or API if there is adequate control. Examples include residue adhering to the wall of a micronizer, residual layer of damp crystals remaining in a centrifuge bowl after discharge, and incomplete discharge of fluids or crystals from a processing vessel upon transfer of the material to the next step in the process. Such carryover should not result in the carryover of degradants or microbial contamination that may adversely alter the established API impurity profile.

8.51 Production operations should be conducted in a manner that will prevent contamination of intermediates or APIs by other materials..

8.52 Precautions to avoid contamination should be taken when APIs are handled after purification.

## 9. PACKAGING AND IDENTIFICATION LABELLING OF APIS AND INTERMEDIATES

### 9.1 General

9.10 There should be written procedures describing the receipt, identification, quarantine, sampling, examination and/or testing and release, and handling of packaging and labelling materials.
9.11 Packaging and labelling materials should conform to established specifications. Those that do not comply with such specifications should be rejected to prevent their use in operations for which they are unsuitable.
9.12 Records should be maintained for each shipment of labels and packaging materials showing receipt, examination, or testing, and whether accepted or rejected.

### 9.2 Packaging Materials

9.20 Containers should provide adequate protection against deterioration or contamination of the intermediate or API that may occur during transportation and recommended storage.
9.21 Containers should be clean and, where indicated by the nature of the intermediate or API, sanitized to ensure that they are suitable for their intended use. These containers. should not be reactive, additive, or absorptive so as to alter the quality of the intermediate or API beyond the specified limits.
9.22 If containers are re-used, they should be cleaned in accordance with documented procedures and all previous labels should be removed or defaced.

### 9.3 Label Issuance and Control

9.30 Access to the label storage areas should be limited to authorised personnel..
9.31 Procedures should be used to reconcile the quantities of labels issued, used, and. returned and to evaluate discrepancies found between the number of containers labelled and the number of labels issued. Such discrepancies should be investigated, and the investigation should be approved by the quality unit(s).
9.32 All excess labels bearing batch numbers or other batch-related printing should be. destroyed. Returned labels should be maintained and stored in a manner that prevents mix-ups and provides proper identification.
9.33 Obsolete and out-dated labels should be destroyed.
9.34 Printing devices used to print labels for packaging operations should be controlled to ensure that all imprinting conforms to the print specified in the batch production record..
9.35 Printed labels issued for a batch should be carefully examined for proper identity and. conformity to specifications in the master production record. The results of this examination should be documented.
9.36 A printed label representative of those used should be included in the batch production. record.

### 9.4 Packaging and Labelling Operations

9.40 There should be documented procedures designed to ensure that correct packaging materials and labels are used. 9.41 Labelling operations should be designed to prevent mix-ups. There should be physical.

or spatial separation from operations involving other intermediates or APIs.

9.42 Labels used on containers of intermediates or APIs should indicate the name or. identifying code, the batch number of the product, and storage conditions, when such information is critical to assure the quality of intermediate or API..

9.43 If the intermediate or API is intended to be transferred outside the control of the manufacturer's material management system, the name and address of the manufacturer, quantity of contents, and special transport conditions and any specialn legal requirements should also be included on the label. For intermediates or APIs with an expiry date, the expiry date should be indicated on the label and Certificate of Analysis. For intermediates or APIs with a retest date, the retest date should be. indicated on the label and/or Certificate of Analysis..
9.44 Packaging and labelling facilities should be inspected immediately before use to ensure that all materials not needed for the next packaging operation have been removed. This examination should be documented in the batch production records, the facility log, or other documentation system.
9.45 Packaged and labelled intermediates or APIs should be examined to ensure that containers and packages in the batch have the correct label. This examination should. be part of the packaging operation. Results of these examinations should be recorded in the batch production or control records.
9.46 Intermediate or API containers that are transported outside of the manufacturer's control should be sealed in a manner such that, if the seal is breached or missing, the recipient will be alerted to the possibility that the contents may have been altered.

## 10. STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION

### 10.1 Warehousing Procedures

10.10 Facilities should be available for the storage of all materials under appropriate conditions (e.g. controlled temperature and humidity when necessary). Records should be maintained of these conditions if they are critical for the maintenance of. material characteristics.
10.11 Unless there is an alternative system to prevent the unintentional or unauthorised use of quarantined, rejected, returned, or recalled materials, separate storage areas should be assigned for their temporary storage until the decision as to their future use has been taken.

### 10.2 Distribution Procedures

10.20 APIs and intermediates should only be released for distribution to third parties after they have been released by the quality unit(s). APIs and intermediates can be transferred under quarantine to another unit under the company's control when authorized by the quality unit(s) and if appropriate controls and documentation are in place.
10.21 APIs and intermediates should be transported in a manner that does not adversely affect their quality.
10.22 Special transport or storage conditions for an API or intermediate should be stated on the label.
10.23 The manufacturer should ensure that the contract acceptor (contractor) for transportation of the API or intermediate knows and follows the appropriate transport and storage conditions.
10.24 A system should be in place by which the distribution of each batch of intermediate and/or API can be readily determined to permit its recall.

## 11. LABORATORY CONTROLS

### 11.1 General Controls

11.10 The independent quality unit(s) should have at its disposal adequate laboratory facilities.

11.11 There should be documented procedures describing sampling, testing, approval or rejection of materials, and recording and storage of laboratory data. Laboratory records should be maintained in accordance with Section 6.6.

11.12 All specifications, sampling plans, and test procedures should be scientifically sound and appropriate to ensure that raw materials, intermediates, APIs, and labels and. packaging materials conform to established standards of quality and/or purity.. Specifications and test procedures should be consistent with those included in the registration/filing. There can be specifications in addition to those in the registration/filing. Specifications, sampling plans, and test procedures, including changes to them, should be drafted by the appropriate organizational unit and. reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s).

11.13 Appropriate specifications should be established for APIs in accordance with accepted standards and consistent with the manufacturing process. The specifications should include a control of the impurities (e.g. organic impurities, inorganic impurities, and residual solvents). If the API has a specification for microbiological purity, appropriate action limits for total microbial counts and objectionable organisms should be established and met. If the API has a specification for endotoxins, appropriate action limits should be established and met.

11.14 Laboratory controls should be followed and documented at the time of performance. Any departures from the above described procedures should be documented and. explained.

11.15 Any out-of-specification result obtained should be investigated and documented according to a procedure. This procedure should require analysis of the data,. assessment of whether a significant problem exists, allocation of the tasks for. corrective actions, and conclusions. Any resampling and/or retesting after OOS. results should be performed according to a documented procedure.

11.16 Reagents and standard solutions should be prepared and labelled following written procedures. "Use by' dates should be applied as appropriate for analytical reagents. or standard solutions.

11.17 Primary reference standards should be obtained as appropriate for the manufacture of APIs. The source of each primary reference standard should be documented. Records should be maintained of each primary reference standard's storage and use in accordance with the supplier's recommendations. Primary reference standards obtained from an officially recognised source are normally used without testing if stored under conditions consistent with the supplier's recommendations.

11.18 Where a primary reference standard is not available from an officially recognized source, an "in-house primary standard' should be established.

Appropriate testing should be performed to establish fully the identity and purity of the primary reference standard. Appropriate documentation of this testing should be maintained.

11.19 Secondary reference standards should be appropriately prepared, identified, tested, approved, and stored. The suitability of each batch of secondary reference standard. should be determined prior to first use by comparing against a primary reference. standard. Each batch of secondary reference standard should be periodically. requalified in accordance with a written protocol..

### 11.2 Testing of Intermediates and APIs

11.20 For each batch ot intermediate and APl, appropriate laboratory tests should be conducted to determine conformance to specifications.
11.21 An impurity profile describing the identified and unidentified impurities present in a typical batch produced by a specific controlled production process should normally be established for each API. The impurity profile should include the identity or some. qualitative analytical designation (e.g. retention time), the range of each impurity observed, and classification of each identified impurity (e.g. inorganic, organic, solvent). The impurity profile is normally dependent upon the production process and origin of the API. Impurity profiles are normally not necessary for APIs from herbal or animal tissue origin. Biotechnology considerations are covered in ICH Guideline Q6B.
11.22 The impurity profile should be compared at appropriate intervals against the impurity profile in the regulatory submission or compared against historical data in order to. detect changes to the API resulting from modifications in raw materials, equipment operating parameters, or the production process.
11.23 Appropriate microbiological tests should be conducted on each batch of intermediate and API where microbial quality is specified.

### 11.3 Validation of Analytical Procedures - see Section 12.

### 11.4 Certificates of Analysis

11.40 Authentic Certificates of Analysis should be issued for each batch of intermediate or. API on request.
11.41 Information on the name of the intermediate or API including where appropriate its grade, the batch number, and the date of release should be provided on the Certificate of Analysis. For intermediates or APIs with an expiry date, the expiry date should be provided on the label and Certificate of Analysis. For intermediates or APIs with a retest date, the retest date should be indicated on the label and/or Certificate of Analysis.
11.42 The Certificate should list each test performed in accordance with compendial or. customer requirements, including the acceptance limits, and the numerical results obtained (if test results are numerical).
11.43 Certificates should be dated and signed by authorised personnel of the quality unit(s) and should show the name, address and telephone number of the original manufacturer. Where the analysis has been carried out by a repacker or reprocessor, the Certificate of Analysis should show the name, address and telephone number of the repacker/reprocessor and a reference to the name of the original manufacturer.

### 11.5 Stability Monitoring of APIs

11.50 A documented, on-going testing program should be designed to monitor the stability characteristics of APIs, and the results should be used to confirm appropriate storage conditions and retest or expiry dates.
11.51 The test procedures used in stability testing should be validated and be stability indicating.
11.52 Stability samples should be stored in containers that simulate the market container. For example, if the API is marketed in bags within fiber drums, stability samples can be packaged in bags of the same material and in smaller- scale drums of similar or. identical material composition to the market drums.
11.53. Normally the first three commercial production batches should be placed on the stability monitoring program to confirm the retest or expiry date. However, where data from previous studies show that the API is expected to remain stable for at least two years, fewer than three batches can be used.
11.54. Thereafter, at least one batch per year of API manufactured (unless none is produced that year) should be added to the stability monitoring program and tested at least annually to confirm the stability.
11.55. For APIs with short shelf-lives, testing should be done more frequently. For example, for those biotechnological/biologic and other APIs with shelf-lives of one year or less,. stability samples should be obtained and should be tested monthly for the first three. months, and at three month intervals after that. When data exist that confirm that the. stability of the API is not compromised, elimination of specific test intervals (e.g. 9. month testing) can be considered.
11.56. Where appropriate, the stability storage conditions should be consistent with the ICH

guidelines on stability.

### 11.6 Expiry and Retest Dating

11.60 When an intermediate is intended to be transferred outside the control of the. manufacturer's material management system and an expiry or retest date is assigned, supporting stability information should be available (e.g. published data, test results).
11.61 An API expiry or retest date should be based on an evaluation of data derived from stability studies. Common practice is to use a retest date, not an expiration date.
11.62 Preliminary API expiry or retest dates can be based on pilot scale batches if (1) the pilot batches employ a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates the final process to be used on a commercial manufacturing scale; and (2) the quality of the API represents the material to be made on a commercial scale..
11.63 A representative sample should be taken for the purpose of performing a retest.

### 11.7 Reserve/Retention Samples

11.70 The packaging and holding of reserve samples is for the purpose of potential future evaluation of the quality of batches of API and not for future stability testing purposes.
11.71 Appropriately identified reserve samples of each API batch should be retained for one year after the expiry date of the batch assigned by the manufacturer, or for three years after distribution of the batch, whichever is the longer. For APIs with retest dates, similar reserve samples should be retained for three years after the batch is completely distributed by the manufacturer.
11.72 The reserve sample should be stored in the same packaging system in which the API is stored or in one that is equivalent to or more protective than the marketed packaging system. Sufficient quantities should be retained to conduct at least two full compendial analyses or, when there is no pharmacopoeial monograph, two full specification analyses.

## 12. VALIDATION

### 12.1 Validation Policy

2.10 The company's overall policy, intentions, and approach to validation, including the validation of production processes, cleaning procedures, analytical methods, inprocess control test procedures, computerized systems, and persons responsible for design, review, approval and documentation of each validation phase, should be documented.

12.11 The critical parameters/attributes should normally be identified during the development stage or from historical data, and the ranges necessary for the reproducible operation should be defined. This should include: > Defining the API in terms of its critical product attributes; > Identifying process parameters that could affect the critical quality attributes of the API; $\triangleright$ Determining the range for each critical process parameter expected to be used during routine manufacturing and process control.

12.12 Validation should extend to those operations determined to be critical to the quality and purity of the API.

### 12.2 Validation Documentation

12.20 A written validation protocol should be established that specifies how validation of a particular process will be conducted. The protocol should be reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s) and other designated units.
12.21 The validation protocol should specify critical process steps and acceptance criteria as well as the type of validation to be conducted (e.g. retrospective, prospective, concurrent) and the number of process runs..
12.22 A validation report that cross-references the validation protocol should be prepared, summarising the results obtained, commenting on any deviations observed, and drawing the appropriate conclusions, including recommending changes to correct deficiencies.
12.23 Any variations from the validation protocol should be documented with appropriate justification.

### 12.3 Qualification

.30 Before starting process validation activities, appropriate qualification of critical. equipment and ancillary systems should be completed. Qualification is usually carried out by conducting the following activities, individually or combined:. > Design Qualification (DQ): documented verification that the proposed design of the. facilities, equipment, or systems is suitable for the intended purpose.. $\triangleright$ Installation Qualification (IQ): documented verification that the equipment or systems, as installed or modified, comply with the approved design, the manufacturer's recommendations and/or user requirements. $\triangleright$ Operational Qualification (OQ): documented verification that the equipment or systems, as installed or modified, perform as intended throughout the anticipated operating ranges. > Performance Qualification (PQ): documented verification that the equipment and.

ancillary systems, as connected together, can perform effectively and reproducibly based on the approved process method and specifications.

### 12.4 Approaches to Process Validation

12.40 Process Validation (PV) is the documented evidence that the process, operated within established parameters, can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce an

intermediate or API meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes.
12.41 There are three approaches to validation. Prospective validation is the preferred approach, but there are exceptions where the other approaches can be used. These approaches and their applicability are listed below..
12.42 Prospective validation should normally be performed for all API processes as defined in 12.12. Prospective validation performed on an API process should be completed before the commercial distribution of the final drug product manufactured from that API.
12.43 Concurrent validation can be conducted when data from replicate production runs are unavailable because only a limited number of API batches have been produced, API batches are produced infrequently, or API batches are produced by a validated process that has been modified. Prior to the completion of concurrent validation, batches can be released and used in final drug product for commercial distribution based on thorough monitoring and testing of the API batches..
12.44 An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where: (1) Critical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified; (2) Appropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established; (3) There have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and (4) Impurity profiles have been established for the existing API.
12.45 Batches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process. consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process.

### 12.5 Process Validation Program

12.50 The number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the. process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified.

12.51 Critical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included. in the process validation..

12.52 Process validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to or better than historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies.

### 12.6 Periodic Review of Validated Systems

12.60 Systems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need for revalidation.

### 12.7 Cleaning Validation

2.70 Cleaning procedures should normally be validated. In general, cleaning validation should be directed to situations or process steps where contamination or carryover of. materials poses the greatest risk to API quality. For example, in early production it. may be unnecessary to validate equipment cleaning procedures where residues are removed by subsequent purification steps.

12.71 Validation of cleaning procedures should reflect actual equipment usage patterns. If. various APIs or intermediates are manufactured in the same equipment and the equipment is cleaned by the same process, a representative intermediate or API can be selected for cleaning validation. This selection should be based on the solubility and difficulty of cleaning and the calculation of residue limits based on potency,. toxicity, and stability.

12.72 The cleaning validation protocol should describe the equipment to be cleaned, procedures, materials, acceptable cleaning levels, parameters to be monitored and controlled, and analytical methods. The protocol should also indicate the type of samples to be obtained and how they are collected and labelled..

12.73 Sampling should include swabbing, rinsing, or alternative methods (e.g., direct extraction), as appropriate, to detect both insoluble and soluble residues. The. sampling methods used should be capable of quantitatively measuring levels of residues remaining on the equipment surfaces after cleaning. Swab sampling may be. impractical when product contact surfaces are not easily accessible due to equipment design and/or process limitations (e.g., inner surfaces of hoses, transfer pipes, reactor tanks with small ports or handling toxic materials, and small intricate equipment such as micronizers and microfluidizers)..

12.74 Validated analytical methods having sensitivity to detect residues or contaminants. should be used. The detection limit for each analytical method should be sufficiently. sensitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or contaminant. The method's attainable recovery level should be established. Residue limits should be. practical, achievable, verifiable and based on the most deleterious residue. Limits can. be established based on the minimum known pharmacological, toxicological, or.

physiological activity of the API or its most deleterious component.

12.75 Equipment cleaning/sanitization studies should address microbiological and endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile products).

12.76 Cleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals after validation to. ensure that these procedures are effective when used during routine production.. Equipment cleanliness can be monitored by analytical testing and visual examination,. where feasible. Visual inspection can allow detection of gross contamination concentrated in small areas that could otherwise go undetected by sampling and/or analysis.

### 12.8 Validation of Analytical Methods

12.80 Analytical methods should be validated unless the method employed is included in the relevant pharmacopoeia or other recognised standard reference. The suitability of all testing methods used should nonetheless be verified under actual conditions of use and documented.
12.81 Methods should be validated to include consideration of characteristics included within the ICH guidelines on validation of analytical methods. The degree of. analytical validation performed should reflect the purpose of the analysis and the stage of the API production process. validation of analytical methods.
12.83 Complete records should be maintained of any modification of a validated analytical method. Such records should include the reason for the modification and appropriate. data to verify that the modification produces results that are as accurate and reliable. as the established method.

## 13. CHANGE CONTROL

13.10 A formal change control system should be established to evaluate all changes that may

affect the production and control of the intermediate or API.
13.11 Written procedures should provide for the identification, documentation, appropriate review, and approval of changes in raw materials, specifications, analytical methods, facilities, support systems, equipment (including computer hardware), processing steps, labelling and packaging materials, and computer software.
13.12 Any proposals for GMP relevant changes should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the appropriate organisational units, and reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s).
13.13 The potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate or API should be evaluated. A classification procedure may help in determining the level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated. process. Changes can be classified (e.g. as minor or major) depending on the nature and extent of the changes, and the effects these changes may impart on the process. Scientific judgement should determine what additional testing and validation studies are appropriate to justify a change in a validated process.
13.14 When implementing approved changes, measures should be taken to ensure that all documents affected by the changes are revised..
13.15 After the change has been implemented, there should be an evaluation of the first batches produced or tested under the change..
13.16 The potential for critical changes to affect established retest or expiry dates should be evaluated. If necessary, samples of the intermediate or API produced by the modified process can be placed on an accelerated stability program and/or can be added to the stability monitoring program..
13.17 Current dosage form manufacturers should be notified of changes from established production and process control procedures that can impact the quality of the API.

## 14. REJECTION AND RE-USE OF MATERIALS

### 14.1 Rejection

14.10 Intermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be identified as such and quarantined. These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or reworked. as described below. The final disposition of rejected materials should be recorded..

### 14.2 Reprocessing

14.20 Introducing an intermediate or API, including one that does not conform to standards or specifications, back into the process and reprocessing by repeating a crystallization. step or other appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps (e.g., distillation, filtration, chromatography, milling) that are part of the established manufacturing. process is generally considered acceptable. However, if such reprocessing is used for a majority of batches, such reprocessing should be included as part of the standard manufacturing process.
14.21 Continuation of a process step after an in-process control test has shown that the step is incomplete is considered to be part of the normal process. This is not considered to be reprocessing.
14.22 Introducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical reaction is considered to be reprocessing unless it is part of the established process. Such reprocessing should be preceded by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality of. the intermediate or API is not adversely impacted due to the potential formation of by-products and over-reacted materials.

### 14.3 Reworking

14.30 Before a decision is taken to rework batches that do not conform to established standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for nonconformance. should be performed.

14.31 Batches that have been reworked should be subjected to appropriate evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process. Concurrent. validation is often the appropriate validation approach for rework procedures. This. allows a protocol to define the rework procedure, how it will be carried out, and the expected results. If there is only one batch to be reworked, then a report can be written and the batch released once it is found to be acceptable..

14.32 Procedures should provide for comparing the impurity profile of each reworked batch against batches manufactured by the established process. Where routine analytical methods are inadequate to characterize the reworked batch, additional methods should be used.

### 14.2 Recovery of Materials and Solvents

14.40 Recovery (e.g. from mother liquor or filtrates) of reactants, intermediates, or the API is considered acceptable, provided that approved procedures exist for the recovery. and the recovered materials meet specifications suitable for their intended use.

14.41 Solvents can be recovered and reused in the same processes or in different processes, provided that the recovery procedures are controlled and monitored to ensure that. solvents meet appropriate standards before reuse or co-mingling with other approved materials.
14.42 Fresh and recovered solvents and reagents can be combined if adequate testing has shown their suitability for all manufacturing processes in which they may be used..
14.43 The use of recovered solvents, mother liquors, and other recovered materials should be adequately documented.

### 14.5 Returns

14.50 Returned intermediates or APIs should be identified as such and quarantined.

14.51 If the conditions under which returned intermediates or APIs have been stored or shipped before or during their return or the condition of their containers casts doubt on their quality, the returned intermediates or APIs should be reprocessed, reworked, or destroyed, as appropriate.

14.52 Records of returned intermediates or APIs should be maintained. For each return, > Name and address of the consignee $\triangleright$ Intermediate or API, batch number, and quantity returned > Reason for return > Use or disposal of the returned intermediate or API

### 15. COMPLAINTS AND RECALLS

15.10 All quality related complaints, whether received orally or in writing, should be recorded and investigated according to a written procedure.

15.11 Complaint records should include: > Name and address of complainant; > Name (and, where appropriate, title) and phone number of person submitting the complaint; $\triangleright$ Complaint nature (including name and batch number of the API); $\triangleright$ Date complaint is received; > Action initially taken (including dates and identity of person taking the action); > Any follow-up action taken; Response provided to the originator of complaint (including date response sent); and $\triangleright$ Final decision on intermediate or API batch or lot.

15.12 Records of complaints should be retained in order to evaluate trends, product- related frequencies, and severity with a view to taking additional, and if appropriate,. immediate corrective action.

15.13 There should be a written procedure that defines the circumstances under which a recall of an intermediate or API should be considered..

15.14 The recall procedure should designate who should be involved in evaluating the information, how a recall should be initiated, who should be informed about the recall, and how the recalled material should be treated.

15.15 In the event of a serious or potentially life-threatening situation, MFDS should be informed and their advice sought.

## 16. CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS (INCLUDING LABORATORIES)

16.10 All contract manufacturers (including laboratories) should comply with the GMP defined in this Guide. Special consideration should be given to the prevention of. cross-contamination and to maintaining traceability.
16.11 Contract manufacturers (including laboratories) should be evaluated by the contract giver to ensure GMP compliance of the specific operations occurring at the contract. sites.
16.12 There should be a written and approved contract or formal agreement between the contract giver and the contract acceptor that defines in detail the GMP. responsibilities, including the quality measures, of each party.
16.13 The contract should permit the contract giver to audit the contract acceptor's facilities for compliance with GMP.
16.14 Where subcontracting is allowed, the contract acceptor should not pass to a third party any of the work entrusted to him under the contract without the contract giver's prior evaluation and approval of the arrangements.
16.15 Manufacturing and laboratory records should be kept at the site where the activity occurs and be readily available.
16.16 Changes in the process, equipment, test methods, specifications, or other contractual requirements should not be made unless the contract giver is informed and approves the changes.

## 17. SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR APIs MANUFACTURED BY CELL CULTURE/FERMENTATION

### 17.1 General

17.10 Section 17 18 is intended to address specific controls for APIs or intermediates manufactured by cell culture or fermentation using natural or recombinant organisms. and that have not been covered adequately in the previous sections. It is not intended. to be a stand-alone Section. In general, the GMP principles in the other sections of. this document apply. Note that the principles of fermentation for "classical' processes for production of small molecules and for processes using recombinant and non-. recombinant organisms for production of proteins and/or polypeptides are the same,. although the degree of control will differ. Where practical, this section will address. these differences. In general, the degree of control for biotechnological processes. used to produce proteins and polypeptides is greater than that for classical. fermentation processes.

17.11 The term \*biotechnological process" (biotech) refers to the use of cells or organisms that have been generated or modified by recombinant DNA, hybridoma or other technology to produce APIs. The APIs produced by biotechnological processes normally consist of high molecular weight substances, such as proteins and polypeptides, for which specific guidance is given in this Section. Certain APIs of. low molecular weight, such as antibiotics, amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrates, can also be produced by recombinant DNA technology. The level of control for these types of APIs is similar to that employed for classical fermentation..

17.12 The term "classical fermentation' refers to processes that use microorganisms existing in nature and/or modified by conventional methods (e.g. irradiation or chemical mutagenesis) to produce APIs. APIs produced by "classical fermentation"' are normally low molecular weight products such as antibiotics, amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrates.

17.13 Production of APIs or intermediates from cell culture or fermentation involves biological processes such as cultivation of cells or extraction and purification of material from living organisms. Note that there may be additional process steps, such as physicochemical modification, that are part of the manufacturing process. The raw materials used (media, buffer components) may provide the potential for growth of microbiological contaminants. Depending on the source, method of preparation, and. the intended use of the API or intermediate, control of bioburden, viral contamination,. and/or endotoxins during manufacturing and monitoring of the process at appropriate stages may be necessary.

17.14 Appropriate controls should be established at all stages of manufacturing to assure intermediate and/or API quality. While this Guide starts at the cell culture/fermentation step, prior steps (e.g. cell banking) should be performed under appropriate process controls. This Guide covers cell culture/fermentation from the. point at which a vial of the cell bank is retrieved for use in manufacturing..

17.15 Appropriate equipment and environmental controls should be used to minimize the. risk of contamination. The acceptance criteria for quality of the environment and the frequency of monitoring should depend on the step in production and the production.

conditions (open, closed, or contained systems).

17.16 In general, process controls should take into account:

$\triangleright$ Maintenance of the Working Cell Bank (where appropriate);.
$\triangleright$ Proper inoculation and expansion of the culture;
$\triangleright$ Control of the critical operating parameters during fermentation/cell culture; $\triangleright$ Monitoring of the process for cell growth, viability (for most cell culture processes). and productivity where appropriate;
$\triangleright$ Harvest and purification procedures that remove cells, cellular debris and media components while protecting the intermediate or API from contamination (particularly of a microbiological nature) and from loss of quality;
$\triangleright$ Monitoring of bioburden and, where needed, endotoxin levels at appropriate stages. of production; and
$\triangleright$ Viral safety concerns as described in ICH Guideline Q5A Quality of Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin.

17.17 Where appropriate, the removal of media components, host cell proteins, other process-related impurities, product-related impurities and contaminants should be. demonstrated.

### 17.2 Cell Bank Maintenance and Record Keeping

17.20 Access to cell banks should be limited to authorized personnel.

17.21 Cell banks should be maintained under storage conditions designed to maintain viability and prevent contamination.
17.22 Records of the use of the vials from the cell banks and storage conditions should be maintained.
17.23 Where appropriate, cell banks should be periodically monitored to determine suitability for use.
17.24 See ICH Guideline Q5D Quality of Biotechnological Products: Derivation and Characterization of Cell Substrates Used for Production of Biotechnological/Biological Products for a more complete discussion of cell banking..

### 17.3 Cell Culture/Fermentation

17.30 Where aseptic addition of cell substrates, media, buffers, and gases is needed, closed or contained systems should be used where possible. If the inoculation of the initial vessel or subsequent transfers or additions (media, buffers) are performed in open vessels, there should be controls and procedures in place to minimize the risk of contamination.
17.31 Where the quality of the API can be affected by microbial contamination, manipulations using open vessels should be performed in a biosafety cabinet or similarly controlled environment.
17.32 Personnel should be appropriately gowned and take special precautions handling the cultures.
17.33 Critical operating parameters (for example temperature, pH, agitation rates, addition of gases, pressure) should be monitored to ensure consistency with the established process. Cell growth, viability (for most cell culture processes), and, where appropriate, productivity should also be monitored. Critical parameters will vary from one process to another, and for classical fermentation, certain parameters (cell viability, for example) may not need to be monitored..
17.34 Cell culture equipment should be cleaned and sterilized after use. As appropriate, fermentation equipment should be cleaned, and sanitized or sterilized..
17.35 Culture media should be sterilized before use when appropriate to protect the quality of the API.
17.36 There should be appropriate procedures in place to detect contamination and determine the course of action to be taken. This should include procedures to determine the impact of the contamination on the product and those to decontaminate the equipment and return it to a condition to be used in subsequent batches. Foreign organisms observed during fermentation processes should be identified as appropriate. and the effect of their presence on product quality should be assessed, if necessary. The results of such assessments should be taken into consideration in the disposition of the material produced.
17.37 Records of contamination events should be maintained..
17.38 Shared (multi-product) equipment may warrant additional testing after cleaning between product campaigns, as appropriate, to minimize the risk of crosscontamination..

### 17.4 Harvesting, Isolation and Purification

17.40 Harvesting steps, either to remove cells or cellular components or to collect cellular components after disruption, should be performed in equipment and areas designed. to minimize the risk of contamination..
17.41 Harvest and purification procedures that remove or inactivate the producing organism, cellular debris and media components (while minimizing degradation, contamination,. and loss of quality) should be adequate to ensure that the intermediate or API is recovered with consistent quality.
17.42 All equipment should be properly cleaned and, as appropriate, sanitized after use. Multiple successive batching without cleaning can be used if intermediate or API quality is not compromised.
17.43 If open systems are used, purification should be performed under environmental conditions appropriate for the preservation of product quality..
17.44 Additional controls, such as the use of dedicated chromatography resins or additional testing, may be appropriate if equipment is to be used for multiple products.

### 17.5 Viral Removal/Inactivation Steps

17.50 See the ICH Guideline Q5A Quality of Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin for more specific information..
17.51 Viral removal and viral inactivation steps are critical processing steps for some processes and should be performed within their validated parameters.
17.52 Appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent potential viral contamination from pre-viral to post-viral removal/inactivation steps. Therefore, open processing should be performed in areas that are separate from other processing activities and have separate air handling units.
17.53 The same equipment is not normally used for different purification steps. However, if the same equipment is to be used, the equipment should be appropriately cleaned and sanitized before reuse. Appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent potential virus carry-over (e.g. through equipment or environment) from previous steps.

## 18. APIs FOR USE IN CLINICAL TRIALS

### 18.1 General

18.10 Not all the controls in the previous sections of this Guide are appropriate for the manufacture of a new API for investigational use during its development. Section 18 provides specific guidance unique to these circumstances.
18.11 The controls used in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials should be consistent with the stage of development of the drug product incorporating the API. Process and test procedures should be flexible to provide for changes as knowledge of the process increases and clinical testing of a drug product progresses from preclinical stages through clinical stages. Once drug development reaches the stage where the API is produced for use in drug products intended for clinical trials, manufacturers should ensure that APIs are manufactured in suitable facilities using appropriate production and control procedures to ensure the quality of the API.

### 18.2 Quality

18.20 Appropriate GMP concepts should be applied in the production of APIs for use in clinical trials with a suitable mechanism of approval of each batch.
18.21 A quality unit(s) independent from production should be established for the approval. or rejection of each batch of API for use in clinical trials..
18.22 Some of the testing functions commonly performed by the quality unit(s) can be performed within other organizational units.
18.23 Quality measures should include a system for testing of raw materials, packaging. materials, intermediates, and APIs.
18.24 Process and quality problems should be evaluated.
18.25 Labelling for APIs intended for use in clinical trials should be appropriately controlled and should identify the material as being for investigational use.

### 18.3 Equipment and Facilities

18.30 During all phases of clinical development, including the use of small-scale facilities. or laboratories to manufacture batches of APIs for use in clinical trials, procedures. should be in place to ensure that equipment is calibrated, clean and suitable for its. intended use.
18.31 Procedures for the use of facilities should ensure that materials are handled in a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination and cross-contamination..

### 18.4 Control of Raw Materials

18.40 Raw materials used in production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be evaluated by testing, or received with a supplier's analysis and subjected to identity testing.. When a material is considered hazardous, a supplier's analysis should suffice..
18.41 In some instances, the suitability of a raw material can be determined before use based. on acceptability in small-scale reactions (i.e., use testing) rather than on analytical. testing alone.

### 18.5 Production

18.50 The production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be documented in laboratory. notebooks, batch records, or by other appropriate means. These documents should include information on the use of production materials, equipment, processing, and. scientific observations.

18.51 Expected yields can be more variable and less defined than the expected yields used in commercial processes. Investigations into yield variations are not expected.

### 18.6 Validation

18.60 Process validation for the production of APIs for use in clinical trials is normally inappropriate, where a single API batch is produced or where process changes during API development make batch replication difficult or inexact. The combination of controls, calibration, and, where appropriate, equipment qualification assures API quality during this development phase.

18.61 Process validation should be conducted in accordance with Section 12 when batches are produced for commercial use, even when such batches are produced on a pilot or small scale.

### 18.7 Changes

18.70 Changes are expected during development, as knowledge is gained and the production is scaled up. Every change in the production, specifications, or test procedures should. be adequately recorded.

### 18.8 Laboratory Controls

18.80 While analytical methods performed to evaluate a batch of API for clinical trials may not yet be validated, they should be scientifically sound.
18.81 A system for retaining reserve samples of all batches should be in place. This system should ensure that a sufficient quantity of each reserve sample is retained for an appropriate length of time after approval, termination, or discontinuation of an application.
18.81 Expiry and retest dating as defined in Section 11.6 applies to existing APIs used in clinical trials. For new APIs, Section 11.6 does not normally apply in early stages of clinical trials.

### 18.9 Documentation

18.90 A system should be in place to ensure that information gained during the development and the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials is documented and available.
18.91 The development and implementation of the analytical methods used to support the release of a batch of API for use in clinical trials should be appropriately documented.
18.92 A system for retaining production and control records and documents should be used. This system should ensure that records and documents are retained for an appropriate length of time after the approval, termination, or discontinuation of an application.

# REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES

## 1. SCOPE

1.1 This Annex to the Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products (\*the GMP Guide') gives guidance on the taking and holding of reference samples of starting materials, packaging materials or finished products and retention samples of finished products.

1.2 Specific requirements for investigational medicinal products are given in Annex 11 to the Guide.

1.3 This annex also includes guidance on the taking of retention samples for parallel imported / distributed medicinal products.

## 2. PRINCIPLE

2.1 Samples are retained to fulfil two purposes; firstly to provide a sample for analytical testing and secondly to provide a specimen of the fully finished product. Samples may therefore fall into two categories:

Reference sample: a sample of a batch of starting material, packaging material or finished product which is stored for the purpose of being analyzed should the need arise during the shelf life of the batch concerned. Where stability permits, reference samples from. critical intermediate stages (e.g. those requiring analytical testing and release) or. intermediates that are transported outside of the manufacturer's control should be kept.. Retention sample: a sample of a fully packaged unit from a batch of finished product. It is stored for identification purposes. For example, presentation, packaging, labelling,. patient information leaflet, batch number, expiry date should the need arise during the. shelf life of the batch concerned. There may be exceptional circumstances where this requirement can be met without retention of duplicate samples e.g. where small amounts of a batch are packaged for different markets or in the production of very expensive medicinal products.

For finished products, in many instances the reference and retention samples will be presented identically, i.e. as fully packaged units. In such circumstances, reference and. retention samples may be regarded as interchangeable.

2.2 It is necessary for the manufacturer, importer or site of batch release, as specified under section 7 and 8, to keep reference and/or retention samples from each batch of finished product and, for the manufacturer to keep a reference sample from a batch of starting material (subject to certain exceptions - see 3.2 below) and/or intermediate product. Each packaging site should keep reference samples of each batch of primary and printed packaging materials. Availability of printed materials as part of the reference and/or retention sample of the finished product can be accepted.

2.3 The reference and/or retention samples serve as a record of the batch of finished product or starting material and can be assessed in the event of, for example, a dosage form. quality complaint, a query relating to compliance with the marketing authorization, a. 1abelling/packaging query or a pharmacovigilance report.

2.4 Records of traceability of samples should be maintained and be available for review by

## 3. DURATION OF STORAGE

3.1 Reference and retention samples from each batch of finished product should be retained for at least one year after the expiry date. The reference sample should be contained in its finished primary packaging or in packaging composed of the same material as the primary container in which the product is marketed.

3.2 Unless a longer period is required under the law of the country of manufacture (whose competent authority is a PIC/S Member), samples of starting materials (other than solvents, gases or water used in the manufacturing process) should be retained for at least. two years after the release of product. That period may be shortened if the period of stability of the material, as indicated in the relevant specification, is shorter. Packaging. materials should be retained for the duration of the shelf life of the finished product concerned.

## 4. SIZE OF REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES

4.1 The reference sample should be of sufficient size to permit the carrying out, on, at least, two occasions, of the full analytical controls on the batch in accordance with the Marketing Authorisation File which has been assessed and approved by the relevant Competent Authority / Authorities. Where it is necessary to do so, unopened packs should be used when carrying out each set of analytical controls. Any proposed exception. to this should be justified to, and agreed with, the relevant competent authority..

4.2 Where applicable, national requirements relating to the size of reference samples and, if necessary, retention samples, should be followed.

4.3 Reference samples should be representative of the batch of starting material, intermediate. product or finished product from which they are taken. Other samples may also be taken. to monitor the most stressed part of a process (e.g. beginning or end of a process). Where. a batch is packaged in two, or more, distinct packaging operations, at least one retention sample should be taken from each individual packaging operation. Any proposed. exception to this should be justified to, and agreed with, the relevant competent authority.

4.4 It should be ensured that all necessary analytical materials and equipment are still available, or are readily obtainable, in order to carry out all tests given in the specification until one year after expiry of the last batch manufactured.

## 5. STORAGE CONDITIONS

Storage conditions should be in accordance with the marketing authorisation (e.g. refrigerated storage where relevant).

## 6. WRITTEN AGREEMENTS

6.1 Where the marketing authorization holder is not the same legal entity as the site(s) responsible for batch release, the responsibility for taking and storage of reference/retention samples should be defined in a written agreement between the two parties. This applies also where any manufacturing or batch release activity is carried out at a site other than that with overall responsibility for the batch and the arrangements between each different site for the taking and keeping of reference and retention samples should be defined in a written agreement.
6.2 The Authorised Person who certifies a batch for sale should ensure that all relevant reference and retention samples are accessible at all reasonable times. Where necessary, the arrangements for such access should be defined in a written agreement.
6.3 Where more than one site is involved in the manufacture of a finished product, the availability of written agreements is key to controlling the taking and location of reference and retention samples.

## 7. REFERENCE SAMPLES - GENERAL POINTS

7.1 Reference samples are for the purpose of analysis and, therefore, should be conveniently. available to a laboratory with validated methodology. For starting materials and. packaging materials used for medicinal products, this is the original site of manufacture. of the finished product. For finished products, this is the original site of manufacture.

## 8. RETENTION SAMPLES - GENERAL POINTS

8.1 A retention sample should represent a batch of finished products as distributed and may need to be examined in order to confirm non-technical attributes for compliance with the. marketing authorization or national legislation. The retention samples should preferably be stored at the site where the Authorised Person (AP) certifying the finished product. batch is located.
8.2 Retention samples should be stored at the premises of an authorised manufacturer in order to permit ready access by the Competent Authority.
8.3 Where more than one manufacturing site is involved in the manufacture. importation/packaging/testing/batch release, as appropriate of a product, the responsibility for taking and storage of retention samples should be defined in a written. agreement(s) between the parties concerned.

## 9. REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES IN THE CASE OF CLOSEDOWN OF A MANUFACTURER

9.1 Where a manufacturer closes down and the manufacturing authorisation is surrendered, revoked, or ceases to exist, it is probable that many unexpired batches of medicinal products manufactured by that manufacturer remain on the market. In order for those batches to remain on the market, the manufacturer should make detailed arrangements for transfer of reference and retention samples (and relevant GMP documentation) to an authorised storage site.
